I"—(<h4 id="exactly-me">Exactly Me</h4>

<p>Exactly me<br />
Exactly me</p>

<p>The chains go round and round<br />
I fill the space with my empty head<br />
Stumbling and sliding through the night<br />
Lying painful in my bed</p>

<p>Exactly this moment<br />
And Iâ€™m turning side by fire<br />
And when Iâ€™m alone<br />
Oh no, again Iâ€™m alone<br />
Where this journey ends<br />
The sad-filled time expires</p>

<p>Exactly me<br />
Exactly me</p>

<p>No I see through this dance<br />
I insist its a trance<br />
And the moons they plod in their orbits<br />
The vampires coo<br />
No, nothingâ€™s new<br />
Still the morning falls all the harder</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>This is nowhere to be<br />
When I donâ€™t know where to go<br />
I want so much to say yes<br />
But I wake up shouting no<br />
Dig in or retreat<br />
Forfeit or cast away<br />
Or quiet, hold your head<br />
There is a way</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<h4 id="a-candle-for-the-sun">A Candle for the Sun</h4>

<p>I lost a candle to the rising sun<br />
Found myself doing things Iâ€™d never done<br />
I left my life as I knew it to rot<br />
I was selling things of mine I hadnâ€™t bought</p>

<p>This story begins in yesteryear<br />
A child sits in a corner of fear<br />
He has one match and a candle to<br />
To come up even he knows what heâ€™s got to do</p>

<p>He strikes the match and the room is lit<br />
His eyes adjust, take in bit by bit<br />
He moves the match closer to the candle<br />
And when the wick fires, thatâ€™s his lifeâ€™s preambleee</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>He pokes around, asks, Whatâ€™s this place about?<br />
Without a word, the bones reply, You should get out<br />
This roomâ€™s a hole in the bottom of a pit<br />
But your flame is bright, just keep it lit</p>

<p>He cuts his knee and he wipes his brow<br />
He seeks the truth, heâ€™s climbing up and out<br />
The wick grows short, it burns his hand<br />
So what: hear the crack of dawn, feel the gust, itâ€™s open land</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<h4 id="overcome">Overcome</h4>

<p>While my body stays in<br />
And my soul flies out<br />
I wonder why Iâ€™m singing<br />
When I barely know what Iâ€™m about</p>

<p>Brother said, Be cool, go slow, just hang<br />
Maybe Iâ€™ll feel a change<br />
I trip, I fall, I feel wholly dumb<br />
Still, I keep my pretensions to overcome</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the method, not the madness<br />
Though the words be transcendent<br />
Complicated by my false humility<br />
Juxtaposed with an arrogant tranquility</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Beaten and cornered, the boy will fight<br />
Then to survive is to know heâ€™s right<br />
If a door open up, heâ€™ll take his flight<br />
The wings of his mind free him from his might</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<h4 id="the-truth-is-mine-to-know">The Truth Is Mine to Know</h4>

<p>Thank you<br />
But, no thank you</p>

<p>Oh, heal me, fire in the night<br />
Close these wounds and banish my fright<br />
Lead my from the darkness to light Iâ€™ve barely known<br />
Take this feeble heart and tell me what youâ€™ve shown</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve given up my upbringing<br />
And all the lies therein<br />
Iâ€™ve broken through it singing<br />
I see my soul robed in the colors of heaven</p>

<p>Tearing through the falsehood<br />
Bearing all the truth it could<br />
Itâ€™s here<br />
They say the truth is relative<br />
But the rock ainâ€™t relative</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />
But no, thank you</p>

<p>Iâ€™m alive<br />
I remember</p>

<h4 id="i-recognize-i">I recognize I</h4>

<p>If these tears are not mine<br />
Then my path you could define<br />
But I hear this wail as my own<br />
And so I cannot fetch your bones</p>

<p>I recognize I<br />
Until the day I die<br />
On that day I can no longer see<br />
I trust you to bury me</p>

<p>There is a picture of you and Father<br />
King-like he holds you as your eyes stream water<br />
Perhaps you were tripped as you chased your ball<br />
And his scepter could not break your fall</p>

<p>Now that weâ€™ve sailed from his realm<br />
I think youâ€™ve seen that one must man his own helm</p>

<p>What do you want of me, wonâ€™t you just say?<br />
The sounding of brass must needs drive me away<br />
Act as my consience, youâ€™ll play to a shell<br />
This waterâ€™s poison, find a new well</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<h4 id="will">Will</h4>

<p>I donâ€™t got it<br />
But I want it<br />
I donâ€™t know what it is<br />
I just know that itâ€™s there</p>

<p>I will search it out<br />
And forsake my doubt<br />
I defy the mob<br />
And its doctrine of despair</p>

<p>Chorus:<br />
I am your child<br />
But I am still doing this<br />
Picking up what was your burden<br />
Gonna find my way to bliss</p>

<p>If you find this song a mystery<br />
You probably grew up with hope and history<br />
Hope that someday things will get better<br />
History of the fact that they never did</p>

<p>You question my anger<br />
You are amused<br />
It kind of makes me wonder<br />
Are your children confused<br />
About their desires<br />
And why they are here<br />
Cause that is just what happens<br />
When youâ€™re born in love and raised in fear</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Iâ€™m staking my life<br />
On a very dangerous thing<br />
On a 40 year old man<br />
Who knows about what I sing</p>

<p>Whoâ€™ll give me the rites of passage<br />
And show me the work of his hands<br />
Heâ€™ll call forth my spirit<br />
And Iâ€™ll come forth a man</p>

<p>Chorus<br />
First verse</p>

<h4 id="descend">Descend</h4>

<p>Gospel mission<br />
City street<br />
Ancient forest<br />
Public beach<br />
There I walked and I slept<br />
There I worked and I wept</p>

<p>Things fall apart</p>

<p>My sadness<br />
Sweet with age<br />
Staled to numbness<br />
Rotted to rage<br />
Rage melted to silence<br />
And silence became my cage</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not angry<br />
I am sad<br />
From myself it well<br />
But hiding has broken my back<br />
Iâ€™ve been shoveling coal in hell</p>

<p>Something bellows in my brain<br />
Like commandment from god:<br />
You were injured<br />
Unearth the pain<br />
Itâ€™s buried under the sod</p>

<p>Things fall apart</p>

<p>Though I want you<br />
I beware you<br />
I will frustrate you ways of harm<br />
I am hurt some day I will trust you<br />
To hold me in your arms</p>

<h4 id="farewell">Farewell</h4>

<p>I donâ€™t care about getting ahead<br />
I just want to break even<br />
Yes you heard me right<br />
When I said<br />
After Iâ€™ve paid my debt, Iâ€™m leaving<br />
For good<br />
Did you ever think I would</p>

<p>So this is my leaving song<br />
I wish to say farewell<br />
Iâ€™ll throw down all my possessions<br />
By a healing water well<br />
Watch the face in the shadowy water<br />
Hear it sing my namee<br />
Here the sound the I grew deaf to<br />
While playing this game</p>

<p>To the north woods or the deserts in the south<br />
Wherever Iâ€™m allowed to survive<br />
If to Earth, Iâ€™m a burden<br />
Let me drown in the riverâ€™s mouth<br />
Better dead in harmony<br />
Than discordant and alive</p>

<p>And Iâ€™ll be wild as a doe<br />
And watch the flowers grow<br />
Feel a desert heat wave roll<br />
Scorching some truth from my soul</p>

<p>I think they planned for my embittered wrath<br />
Strategically numbing me and diverting me from my path<br />
So Iâ€™m on my way, Iâ€™m getting off the beaten path<br />
Open up to the signs and find my way back</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<h4 id="odyssey">Odyssey</h4>

<p>Odysseys<br />
And time fell on a snowflake</p>

<p>Iâ€™m nearly done with farming<br />
Can you see the pines<br />
Waving you goodbye<br />
Citylife?</p>

<p>I am green<br />
With the sounds my bare feet make<br />
On the spongy leaves-will-be-humus</p>

<p>I twist at my ankles<br />
Bugs of joy<br />
Crawl in anticipation<br />
Up my tibia and fibia</p>

<p>Odysseys<br />
And time fell on a snowflake</p>

<p>More pine boughs<br />
Usher me to sleep<br />
At the treeâ€™s base</p>

<p>At the base of a tree<br />
In my Odysseyâ€¦</p>

<h4 id="minstrels-lullaby">Minstrelâ€™s lullaby</h4>

<p>Far away, far away<br />
I must go far away<br />
There is water whence I go<br />
Far away</p>

<p>Oâ€™er the hill, oâ€™er the hill<br />
I will climb up oâ€™er the hill<br />
I will quench my thirst<br />
I will drink my fill<br />
Oâ€™er the hill</p>

<p>But while Iâ€™m here<br />
Reason makes the rhyme<br />
The heart keeps the time<br />
The rooster tells us when to fall asleep</p>

<p>Itâ€™s so simple itâ€™s so easy<br />
You can sit all night and grin<br />
And when the child knocks, you let him in</p>

<h4 id="untitled-love-song">untitled love song</h4>

<p>She is ready, she is Tona<br />
She says, I like you, I wannaâ€¦<br />
You know what I mean</p>

<p>Yes, I know what you mean all too well<br />
Thatâ€™s the garden where I was forbidden to dwell<br />
But if you hold the gate awhile<br />
Iâ€™ll be along to share your smile<br />
And Iâ€™ll bring you a rose<br />
A cutting for the garden</p>

<p>The sun sets, and you tire<br />
The wind through the leaves<br />
Like fingers on a lyre<br />
But tarry longer<br />
Let the gold fire wane<br />
Iâ€™m walking straight down the lane<br />
To bring you a rose<br />
A cutting for the garden</p>

<p>I come at dark, you look down<br />
You point the way<br />
I plant the branch in the ground<br />
There I sleep<br />
While you go off to bed<br />
In the morning<br />
Youâ€™ll see the rose is red</p>

<p>And youâ€™ll bar the gate<br />
The entrance to the garden<br />
Where I want to live<br />
The rest of my life</p>

<h4 id="roots">Roots</h4>

<p>Where are my roots?</p>

<p>I take off my shoes I take off my socks<br />
To find with my feet what we what I have lost<br />
I splash in the mud I roll in the dirt<br />
I run on the land that for roots must come first</p>

<p>Yeah, Mother<br />
Yeah, Father<br />
You gave shelter, clothes and food<br />
But you missed something<br />
Where are my roots?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m floating up my headâ€™s a hot air balloon<br />
Canâ€™t feel the ground if I donâ€™t have any roots<br />
I was driving through the midwest<br />
Behind a rest stop I ran<br />
I dove my fingers into the dirt<br />
Into the Earth<br />
Into the soil<br />
Into the land</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Walking weary by the edge of the road<br />
Thumbing for a ride<br />
Now roots for a displaced people<br />
Roots for them, they grow inside</p>

<p>Chorus</p>
