I"<p>Very off-topic note about how I have come to think of long periods of silence and repeated non-responses in text communication with computer technicians. When it happens I assume one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the issue:
    <ul>
      <li>was addressed before</li>
      <li>is so basic I should already know about it</li>
      <li>is easy enough in their minds for me to work out on my own</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>they don’t know</li>
  <li>they would like to but can’t</li>
  <li>they aren’t interested</li>
  <li>the answer is no</li>
</ul>

<p>As long as my message contained no interesting requests or instructions, why would they respond? It’s like a logic circuit. Or, at least, my idea of one.</p>

<p>I have read forums. There is simply too much data to respond to. One must not suffer fools or welcome the cloying “friendship” of a zillion strangers.</p>

<p>It took me awhile, but I’d like to think I get it. Here’s to the techs. I’m on your side. Thank you for making computers happen.</p>
