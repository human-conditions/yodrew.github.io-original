I"Ò<p>[EDIT: I learned this is not a syllogism, just a regular old argument. Syllogisms have only three propositions. Sigh.]</p>

<p>Here is my clearest articulation yet of the conjectureâ€™s chain of causation, in the form of a seven-line syllogism:</p>

<p>Suffering comes from a catastrophic injury to the psyche;
the psyche is a system of an organism;
organisms are self-healing;
healing requires vital energy;
vital energy accumulates during rest;
psychic rest is most profound in absolute darkness;
therefore, darkness is the solution to inordinate suffering.</p>

<p>[EDIT: See end of <a href="/hygiene/">hygiene</a>/psychology and <a href="/darkness-conjecture/basics/">basics</a> for updated versions of this.]</p>
