I"≤`<p>In civilization, we are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over-stimulated and distressed. We need relief.</li>
  <li>exhausted. We need rest.</li>
  <li>hurt and sick. We need recovery.</li>
</ul>

<p>How? By <em>hygienic darkroom retreating</em>: profound rest in total darkness for the self-healing organism. It is a rational method of switching off the world, with its noise and demands. One takes refuge in the deep self, supporting it in healing itself by itself. This book is a complete manual for understanding and doing it.</p>

<h4 id="basics">basics</h4>

<h5 id="how-it-works">how it works</h5>

<ol>
  <li>The psyche, as an organic system, is self-healing.</li>
  <li>The primary condition of healing is rest.</li>
  <li>Profound psychic rest occurs in extended total darkness <em>as a physiological response</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Because the process of healing is automatic, it is foolproof. The psyche needs darkness for rest like lungs need air for breathing and eyes need light for seeing. It knows no substitute. Healing happens involuntarily‚Äîby itself‚Äîwhen conditions of rest are sufficiently provided. This is fully developed in <a href="/hygiene#secret"><em>hygiene &gt; secret</em></a> and contextualized in<br />
<a href="/psychology#hygienic-psychology"><em>psychology &gt; hygienic psychology</em></a>.</p>

<p>This book tells how to provide them, from abstract theory to concrete practice. Most importantly, it introduces the <em>hygienic attitude</em>. Merely knowing it opens the door to super-intensified healing, ie, miracles. When you are ready, you can walk through it. The book includes designs for darkroom components precise to the millimeter so even amateurs can get them right. It inspires you to heal and support others in healing by revealing what healing requires.</p>

</dl>

<p>Here is a note on my use of words.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt use neologisms. I don‚Äôt use words in any special sense. Virtually any dictionary will clear up confusion you may have while reading. Read through the senses and the etymology as well.</p>

<p>My usage is sometimes unusual because I take pains to recover the original or essential meanings of words using etymology and historical usage. Popular use and manipulation by elites constantly degrade the true senses of high-level abstractions. Words become corrupt or acquire unfortunate associations. Language is artificial and must be maintained.</p>

<p>I consider this half the job of intellectuals and our audiences alike. The Oxford English Dictionary exemplifies this effort. Editions of American Heritage Dictionary and Webster‚Äôs from before 1970 are excellent. Beware of newer lexicology. It is both better and worse than ever due to extreme divergence of philosophical influences in the last 40 years.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">requirements</h5>

<p>To retreat, one needs three things: knowledge, materials, and support.</p>

<ul>
  <li>knowledge:
    <ul>
      <li>of theory and practice of hygienic darkroom retreating</li>
      <li>of hygienic attitude</li>
      <li>of oneself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>materials 
      - darkroom
      - personal belongings
      - food
      - time</li>
  <li>support
    <ul>
      <li>hygiene is the basis on which sick people can help each other without making things worse</li>
      <li>our problem is collective and is solved with increasing degrees of cooperation as we become more capable of it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Meet these requirements by reading this book, preparing for a retreat, and retreating. Your first retreats are just warm-ups. You will get better at it.</p>

<h5 id="darkroom">darkroom</h5>

<p>A darkroom is a bedroom, suite, or house that is perfectly dark. Sealing a room like this often requires additional ventilation measures. A darkroom can be basic or deluxe. To summarize the practical point of this book, I advocate arranging basic darkness in your bedroom now, deluxe darkness in a remote location later.</p>

<p>Basic darkness means perfectly dark, well-ventilated, reasonably quiet, and comfortable. This provides: darkness for nightly sleep; a place to familiarize yourself with extended darkness at your own pace; and a place for your first short retreats.</p>

<p>Deluxe darkness adds extra features, comforts, and space. A dedicated darkroom is built in a small fully functional house in a quiet location. Like all houses should be but are not, it is perfectly and easily darkened. More in <a href="/design"><em>design</em></a>.</p>

<h4 id="background">background</h4>

<h5 id="nature">nature</h5>

<p>Darkness is instinctive. We sleep in it at night and nap in shadows. We use our hands to cover our eyes when overwhelmed. We take longer refuge in caves and shelters when injured. We and many other animals always have.</p>

<p>Absolute darkness is natural. Our natural habitat is tropical forest. At night its floor is pitch black.</p>

<h5 id="traditions">traditions</h5>

<p>Spiritual traditions have used darkness for millennia. They tend to view it as the ultimate environment for self-discipline and gaining unusual knowledge. Egyptians and Maya have used it in pyramids; Christians in catacombs; Sufis and Taoists in caves; Tibetan Buddhists in cells of monasteries.</p>

<p>Indigenous traditions do likewise: Amazonian shamanism uses darkness in ayahuasca ceremony. Welsh shamans and Navajo, Maya, and Kogi Indians alike build special dark structures, holding darkness in high regard as essential to self-discovery.</p>

<p>Western science has studied sensory destimulation since the 1950s for astronautics, health, and mind-control. Ayurveda, India‚Äôs ancient healing tradition, uses extended periods of darkness for rejuvenation. By <a href="/reports/365-day-retreat-of-150-year-old-yogi">reports</a>, it is nothing less than the fountain of youth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the partially or completely active nature of these approaches to darkroom retreating compromises them. This means they depend on an active will, the faculty most in need of rest. Hygiene is passive, allowing the distressed will to finally rest and recover. Hygiene primarily depends on the autonomic self‚Äîomniscient, omnipotent, and infallible‚Äîto accomplish the work of healing. This removes structural conflict in the method, promising <a href="/blog/2011/05/limitless">limitless</a> results. Hygiene completely secularizes the use of darkness for the specific purpose of healing. There is nothing mystical, disciplined, or complicated about this approach. It is rational, safe, and natural: a reliable miracle.</p>

<h5 id="hygiene">hygiene</h5>

<p>Hygiene is not just cleanliness, as medicine has led us to believe. Hygiene is broad and deep, dealing with all conditions of health. We know the word today because of <em>Natural Hygiene</em>, a radical school of natural health originating in America in 1832. It led the global natural health movement of the 19th century. Hygiene respects the self-preserving nature of life. It observes that organisms both maintain and recover health under normal conditions of life. So it studies organic self-preservation and how to provide its conditions.</p>

<p>Normal conditions of life include fresh air, sunlight, natural food, and cleanliness by regular bathing. Hygiene taught the modern world their enormous benefits, significantly raising health standards worldwide. Its motto: ‚ÄúHealth through healthful living‚Äù. It has only lacked a psychology and an appreciation for trauma as the cause of all illness; this book begins to correct that.</p>

<p>Hygiene identifies disease <strong><em>as</em></strong> the process of healing. Disease is the normal organic activity of self-repair, elimination, and re-energizing, but distressed by abnormal conditions. Thus, disease is not an invading entity to be fought. It is a beneficial process to support with healthy conditions and practices and to view as a set of clues to precisely guide this caregiving.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of hygiene help us reconnect with our own common sense about healing. They guide us past incorrect assumptions we likely have about it. Once you have these absolute basics down, you can learn the concrete details of a darkroom retreat and approach it with confidence. Moreover, hygiene provides guidance in all aspects of healthful living.</p>

<p>My parents had taught me the importance of eating well through their interest in natural diet. When I was 9 years old, I got sick and realized it was from the junk food I had eaten the day before. Diet became my religion for 30 years.</p>

<p>Natural Hygiene came knocking three times. The first time was in 1989 through my dad‚Äôs second wife, Jennifer Justice, also a truthseeker. Among her fascinating books I found the ecstatic <em>Fit for Life</em> by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond. Again in 1992 through a great friend, Sterling Voss. In the greatest letter anyone ever wrote me, he told me about <em>Fasting Can Save Your Life</em> by Herbert Shelton, hygiene‚Äôs systematizer. Finally, in 2001, through friend and colleague, Frederic Patenaude. He was the editor of <em>Just Eat An Apple</em> magazine and author of <em>The Raw Secrets</em>. These publications were about the raw vegan diet.</p>

<h6 id="frederic">frederic</h6>

<p>I worked and was housemates with <a href="http://fredericpatenaude.com">Frederic Patenaude</a> a total of three years off and on from 1998 till 2003. We worked  at Nature‚Äôs First Law in California; Tree of Life in Arizona; and at his new office in Quebec. Frederic had started in hygiene not with the works of Herbert Shelton, but the old French hygienic master, Albert Mosseri. Frederic read all his 20+ books and was in contact with him till his death in 2012.</p>

<p>Slowly, I absorbed the essence of Natural Hygiene‚Äôs radical perspective through Frederic. By this, I mean he got it through my thick skull with his calm, relentless, crystalline arguments. I was challenging but sympathetic, so I kept asking and he kept answering. It took time because I started out quite lost. A mess of alternative dietary ideas floated around my head since childhood. Something finally clicked and I started studying hygiene on my own.</p>

<p>Frederic‚Äôs dedication and great knowledge made him immovable where I was merely stubborn. I can only hope to return the favor with the current work. It illuminates certain mysteries of diet that frustrated us. Like why some people can stick with eating healthy food and others can‚Äôt (see <a href="/hygiene#capacity"><em>hygiene &gt; capacity</em></a>). And the greater mystery of metaphysical suffering that we, like so many others, failed to solve with diet.</p>

<h6 id="finn">finn</h6>

<p>I first heard about darkroom retreating in 2004 from my former guru, Purna Steinitz. An American Hindu, he had heard about its use in Ayurveda. He told me, ‚ÄúApparently, after a few weeks of it, one comes out completely renewed.‚Äù I found the idea very strange. A budding hygienist and attracted to spirituality‚Äôs Apollonian upper world, I thought we needed light. But like a lot of earthy things Purna said, the idea of renewal in darkness stayed with me.</p>

<p>A year later, I moved to an ecovillage in Oregon. I hit it off with the old village maintenance man. Name of <a href="http://www.efn.org/~finnpo/info.html">Finn Po</a>. Scrawny guy. Lots of energy. A hippy from birth since his dad was a beatnik. Wizard-level resourcefulness. Full of wry optimistic sayings as well as good-natured quips about people‚Äôs hang-ups. Drinks his own pee and lives in a tiny geodesic dome he built out of garbage 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Naturally, Finn also had a darkroom.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTired of enlightenment?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúTry endarkenment.‚Äù</p>

<p>I said, ‚ÄúOhmigod, Finn, really?!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the way of the future. Don‚Äôt be the last to know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like?‚Äù</p>

<p>Eyes closed, arms wrapped round himself, he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a <em>luxury</em>.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAh, just git in the room.‚Äù</p>

<p>A benevolent Pied Piper and the coolest 60 year-old around, he had inspired all the village‚Äôs youth to try a retreat. After listening to him rhapsodize about it all winter, I did, too.</p>

<p><a href="/reports/four-darkness-experiences">Wow</a>.</p>

<p>But as Finn says, I was just getting started. It would take two more years, the shock of leaving my guru, and another successful retreat for me to grasp the significance of retreating in darkness.</p>

<h6 id="andrew">andrew</h6>

<p>How did all this begin?</p>

<p>My parents were thinkers and somewhat unconventional. They taught me about philosophy, health, design, and music. I took all of it more seriously than they expected. They were distant. My intense older brother became as big a force in my life as they. For me, our house was more training camp than home. Other <a href="/about/bibliography-influences/"><em>influences</em></a> and <a href="/about/acknowledgments/"><em>people</em></a> helped smooth it out.</p>

<p>I felt awed by life at 2, happy at 3. School started and a part of me died. About halfway through, I read <em>The Dark Is Rising</em> series by Susan Cooper. It impressed me. Later came <em>Do You Really Need Eyeglasses?</em>, which introduced me to palming. My father‚Äôs hero, Frank Lloyd Wright, showed me a future without school.</p>

<p>By age 15, I felt morose and alienated. But something from childhood was stirring in me. One day, I was slumped in front of the TV. One of the tiny people living inside it mentioned the importance of loving oneself and being happy. The timing was perfect. My mood was like the Death Star and this advice was Luke Skywalker‚Äôs photon torpedo.</p>

<p>In a moment, I was overcome by <a href="/darkness-conjecture/rapture">rapture</a>: sublime joy in apprehending our perfect, beautiful universe. I had felt it at 3 and 4 years old. Now it was bigger. This perspective and feeling lasted three months. When they faded, so did my previous interests. More than anything, I wanted to understand the cause of joy. I wanted it back.</p>

<p>I finished high school. Barely. I started <a href="http://warmlite.com">living out</a> of a <a href="http://mchalepacks.com">backpack</a>. For 21 years, I independently investigated this mystery. I experimented with the elements of my legacy: philosophy, health, and design. Toward the end of this period, I did my first darkroom retreats. Soon after, in late 2008, the answer came:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A slight increase of vital energy from adolescence had caused a temporary, partial restoration of my damaged psychic integrity, revealing an enrapturing universe. So a massive increase from profound rest in darkness would cause permanent and complete restoration.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this breakthrough, my search ended. Testing of my discovery began. I and 28 clients have tried it. Their results echoed my early ones.</p>

<p>Over the course of my 25 retreats of 2‚Äì7 days, noticeable restoration of my psychic integrity and function has occurred. My body‚Äôs scent has improved. I regained some access to my long-buried sexuality. From one retreat, I woke up feeling like an adult for the first time in 41 years; this feeling has not changed. Alongside my childish panic in the face of challenges, an adult now thinks through them. In retreat, symptoms of fibro-myalgia dissipate. Flexibility returns. I wake up <em>just knowing</em> things that have always mystified me and feeling resolved about issues that have frustrated me for decades. Insomnia, exhaustion, and suicidal thoughts and feelings evaporate. Clarity, energy, relaxedness, even joy return for weeks at a time. Basic functioning lasts two months. All these came to me after going years at a time without them.</p>

<p>Besides this supporting evidence, no data contradicting the basic idea has yet emerged. Interest in darkness is growing worldwide. I met an internationally recognized psychology professor with decades of experience as a flotation researcher. She unqualifiedly agrees with my theory and wants to do research with my exact method. Wherever I go, people are as struck as I am by the simple logic of this idea and want to try a retreat.</p>

<p>As Finn says, what else can go right?</p>

<h5 id="audience">audience</h5>

<p>This book is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who appreciate good arguments and reasonable tests thereof</li>
  <li>those who suffer in any way‚Äîspiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically, socially, ecologically‚Äîand need hope and a way out</li>
  <li>those who sense hygiene‚Äôs greater potential</li>
  <li>self-experimenters and self-explorers who don‚Äôt necessarily have terrible problems, just yearning, curiosity, wonder, or a wish to find their next steps.</li>
  <li>those who wish to understand why humanity is in such rough shape and what to do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Darkroom retreating is for anyone to whom it makes sense and who feels moved to do it, whether to heal from acute illness or just see what it‚Äôs like. Much if not all physical illness is psychosomatic and therefore amenable to self-healing in darkness.</p>

<p>However, darkness is no escape. Sometimes illness needs to be addressed in other obvious ways first. But just knowing about darkroom retreating can be greatly encouraging in doing so. It helps puts things in perspective. And acquaintance with hygienic principles is invaluable to healing from any illness.</p>

<h5 id="how-to-use-this-book">how to use this book</h5>

<p>Above all, this book presents an idea for consideration. For now, doing a retreat is not at issue. To do something like this, you must know how and you must want to. To want to, you must believe in it. To believe, you must know enough about it to find it true. So first, learn the idea. Natural motivation comes from rational belief. Invest your time in knowledge by reading every word of this book, cover to cover. As Finn says, ‚ÄúNothing costs more than what you don‚Äôt pay for.‚Äù</p>

<p>Once you are motivated, use the book as a manual for making basic darkness for yourself at your own place. Download the companion darkroom retreat <a href="/darkroom-retreat.zip">zip file</a> to get all the plans for components<!-- as well as some reference reading -->. Or find a retreat center. See <a href="/prepare"><em>prepare</em></a> for resources.</p>

<p>Help from others may or may not come. You are the one you have been waiting for. The need for self-reliance applies to darkness more than anything else I‚Äôve ever gotten involved with. It has been hard for me to recover enough of a self to rely on, to ferret out remnants of it I didn‚Äôt know I had. But bit by bit, ‚Äúa little here, a little there‚Äù, the task is being accomplished.</p>

<p>The full application of the idea of hygienic darkroom retreating consists of doing retreats of increasing length alternated with periods of making the radical changes in lifeway one becomes capable of in darkness. This includes studying and applying the rest of hygiene. Continue until your psychic integrity and physical health are completely restored. <em>Live</em>.</p>
