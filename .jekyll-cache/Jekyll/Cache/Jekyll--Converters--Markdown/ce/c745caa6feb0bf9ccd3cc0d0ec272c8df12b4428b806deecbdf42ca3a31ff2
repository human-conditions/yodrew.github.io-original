I"À<p>Just came across these three entries in Wikipedia about the strange light that people often experience in darkness retreats:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_effect">Ganzfeld Effect</a>,Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene">Phosphene</a>,Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_cinema">Prisonerâ€™s Cinema</a></p>

<p>â€œCinemaâ€ certainly coincides with my idea of the entertainment value of the light show in the dark. It is just the â€œhallucinationsâ€ that the Ganzfeld Effect entry describes.</p>

<p>But maybe hallucinations are not fabrications of consciousness after all. With enough time inside, I think it will become evident either way.</p>
