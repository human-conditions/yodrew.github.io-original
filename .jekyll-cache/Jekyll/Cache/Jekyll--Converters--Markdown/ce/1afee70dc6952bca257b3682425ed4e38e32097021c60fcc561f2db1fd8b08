I"Á<p>For four years, I have been trying to do a 14-day retreat. I thought short retreats were of little value, that a long retreat was the only action that mattered. But a room good for 14-day retreats is harder to set up than one for 4- or 8-day retreats. In my dysfunction, it was too big a leap for me, like trying to jump across a wide river. In my <a href="http://andrewdurham.com/2x2">last retreat</a>, I discovered my first stepping stone.</p>
