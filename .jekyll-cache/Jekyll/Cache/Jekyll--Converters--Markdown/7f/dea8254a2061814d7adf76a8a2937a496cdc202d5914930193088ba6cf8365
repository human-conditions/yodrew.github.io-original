I"Ÿ<p>Psychology is the study of the psyche, not just the mind. Thus mainstream psychology will continue failing to seriously help people as long as it considers health and illness â€œmentalâ€ rather than â€œpsychicâ€ in nature. The psycheâ€”consciousnessâ€”is not just mental, but emotional and physical as well. Feeling and movement are not mere products of the intellect, but their own forms of intelligence.</p>
