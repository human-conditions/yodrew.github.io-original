I"ü<p>Well, I got <a href="http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/digestion-selected-for-docility/">my first incoming link</a> today* from <a href="http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/">entitled to an opinion</a>, a droll, well-written blog on contemporary social and political issues. The author just wanted an ad-free copy of <a href="/other-writings/origins-of-agriculture/">Origins of Agriculture</a> by Greg Wadley and Angus Martin and found one here. Random, but strangely exciting.</p>
