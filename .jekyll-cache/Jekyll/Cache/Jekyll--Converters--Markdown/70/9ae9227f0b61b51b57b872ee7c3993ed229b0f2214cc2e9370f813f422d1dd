I"<p>Hey, I just came across this excellent web-based credit clearing system:
<a href="http://www.ces.org.za/">Community Exchange System</a> [EDIT: I no longer dig this system. It’s popular but messy.] CES* is international, free, simple, compatible with paper systems, thorough, and cool.  It’s just about what the godfather of new money, Thomas Greco, calls for in <a href="http://beyondmoney.net/excerpts/chapter-17-complete-web-based-trading-platform/"><em>The End of Money and the Future of Civilization</em>, chapter 17</a>.</p>
