I"<p>Iâ€™m collecting myself after my first failed attempt at a long darkness retreat. It only lasted two days, not two weeks as planned. I underestimated the need for quiet and chose a room that proved too noisy.</p>

<p>Thus I now seek a separate, finished building, preferably with a bathroom. I would need as much as a week to prepare it before heading in for 14 days.</p>

<p>If anyone has or knows of a such a finished building; or has any other thoughts, please <a href="/about/">let me know</a>. I can travel.</p>
