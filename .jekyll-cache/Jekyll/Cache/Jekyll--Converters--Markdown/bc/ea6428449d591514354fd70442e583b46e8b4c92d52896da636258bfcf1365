I"<p>Boy, it has been a long time again since I posted.</p>

<p>In the past two years, I have continued developing hygienic darkroom retreating and updating the book. It is almost perfect. I found its last pieces this year. I plan to add them to the book in the next few months. Also, I will simplify the style of the sentences using the Hemingway App. This improves the clarity, makes it easier for non-native speakers to read, and improves results of machine translation. Then it will be ready for publishing in a more serious way.</p>

<p>I have continued on in Europe. I was in Spain for three years. I left almost a year ago to somewher important for the work. More eventually about that.</p>

<p>See my next three posts for new ideas and an update. Thanks for your patience.</p>
