I"Å<p>Thanks to hundreds of people in a dozen countries on 2 continents for over 3 decades, who morally and materially aided me during my prodigal search, especially my:</p>

<h5 id="editors">editors</h5>

<p>‚Ä¶for heroic efforts to make this book real. In triage, you were as merciful as you could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are Solheim, writer and fellow refugee in darkness, for seeing and believing in me and the book, for visionary editing, hosting me during the rewrite, and your compassion for humanity, even me</li>
  <li>
    <p>Magnus Vanebo, philosopher, for enthusiastically diving into the text and sensitively editing it</p>

    <p>Also,</p>
  </li>
  <li>Bertrand Besigye, outlandish poet and fellow journeyman in darkness, for early support of the book</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="family">family</h5>

<p>Immediate, extended, and adopted: I leaned on all of you that would let me. It can‚Äôt be easy rearing a stubborn 20, 30, then 40 year-old psychotic infant in a world that denies everything real. Thanks, especially, to:</p>

  <li>Brother Paul, for shelter and guidance you should never have had to give</li>
  <li>Grandmother Anna Lou Craig Callen Posey, always there</li>
  <li>Brother Francois, for constant experience of love</li>

</ul>

<p>Trimurti: my second family, torn away as soon as I noticed, for helping further raise me</p>

<h5 id="influences">influences</h5>

<p>‚Ä¶for friendship, support, and/or raising the bar so high that anti-gravity boots became necessary. And especially:</p>

<h5 id="elders">elders</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Jack Nuckols: a giant and first among my elders, you took care of me till I found my way. RIP.</li>
  <li>Willetta Warberg: you poured your heart and soul into me through your piano, kindness, and huge personality</li>
  <li>John Boyer: you fed me with so much of your <em>time</em></li>
  <li>Purna Steinitz: you destroyed my sentimentality and kept your terrible promise. Shiva Shambo.</li>
  <li>DeWaynn Rogers: you helped me up and kept me from the system‚Äôs clutches. RIP.</li>
  <li>Finn Po: elder, master job trainer, and pioneer of the way of the future, you could not have done more</li>

<p>I called some people here guides, but anyone who hosted me also guided me. I‚Äôve needed a lot of help for a long time. Everyone on this list put a lot of time and energy into me and my work.</p>

<p>I also made enemies and hurt some people along the way. I‚Äôm sorry it didn‚Äôt go the way we thought at first. Here‚Äôs hoping it was not in vain.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments in books usually bore me. This one I cannot reread without weeping. Onward, then, till the task is complete.</p>
