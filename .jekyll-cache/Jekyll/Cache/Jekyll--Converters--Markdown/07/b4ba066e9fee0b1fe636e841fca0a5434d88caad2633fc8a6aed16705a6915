I"é<p>I changed the name of the site and book. As darkroom retreating is growing a lot, I find it increasingly necessary to differentiate the hygienic from the usual spiritual, therapeutic, and psychedelic approaches. â€œDeep restâ€ unfortunately sounds like depressed, and other hygienists use the phrase, â€œprofound restâ€, so I changed that, too. The essence of the book remains the same, or more so. I have new sections planned and will write them as soon as I am capable. Cheers.</p>
