I"Ë<p>John Zerzan was my neighbor in Eugene, Oregon. I got to know him through a long-lost friend who happened to help edit _Green Anarchy Magazine _with John. It was a great honor to meet him. John even critiqued one of my earlier writings, <a href="/other-writings/sociality-undenied/">Sociality Undenied</a>. But until now, I had not absorbed his basic ideas from books, only gotten a shallow grasp of his thesis from his articles and conversation.</p>

<p>_<a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/john-zerzan-running-on-emptiness-the-failure-of-symbolic-thought">Running on Emptiness: The Pathology of Civilization_</a> is the most intellectually exciting thing I have read in a long time. I knew that suffering, technology, hierarchy were the inventions of civilization. But I did not know time, language, art, and culture itself were, too.</p>

<p>This goes beyond Daniel Quinnâ€™s critique of civilization. Quinnâ€™s and Zerzanâ€™s prescriptions overlap in some ways, differ in others.</p>

<p>Also I find it amazing to read a 60 year-oldâ€™s crying out against the inhumanity of our society with such vehemence as Johnâ€™s. Itâ€™s such a relief from feeling alone in my own protestations. Highly recommended.</p>
