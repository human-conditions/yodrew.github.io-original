I"±<p>I came up with a twist on <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/assurance_contr.html">Dominant Assurance Contracts</a>. Which is economist <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/">Alex Tabarrok</a>â€˜s game theoretical extension of the all-or-nothing Assurance Contract popularized by <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>. In an assurance contract, if pledges toward a financial goal are insufficient by the contractâ€™s deadline, then pledges remain uncollected. With dominant assurance, everyone who offered to contribute gets a <strong>bonus</strong>. â€œThus contribution becomes the <em>dominant</em> strategy,â€ says Dr Tabarrok.</p>
