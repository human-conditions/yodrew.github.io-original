I"³<p>On the <a href="/darkness-conjecture/health-proposal">wish</a> to recover:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two kinds of doingâ€”automatic; and doing what you â€œwishâ€. Take a small thing which you â€œwishâ€ to do and cannot do and make this your God. Let nothing interfere. If you â€œwishâ€, you can. Without wishing, you never â€œcanâ€. â€œWishâ€ is the most powerful thing in the world.
â€”G I Gurdjieff</p>
