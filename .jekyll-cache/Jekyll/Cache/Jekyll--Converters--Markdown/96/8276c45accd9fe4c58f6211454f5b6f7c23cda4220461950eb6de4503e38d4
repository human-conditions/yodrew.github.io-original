I"	<p>At my request, xda developer, verygreen, with support from ros87, has done in 24 hours for $10 and a $109 donated device what tens of companies could/would not do in four years with all their resources (like the $500,000 one company told me it would cost).</p>

<p>Watch him type on the Nook Simple Touch on youtube:

<p>EDIT: for outline of installation instructions, see:<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/BN_Nook_Simple_Touch/USB_host_mode">Installation Wiki</a>
These are at noob-hacker level.</p>

<p>There are still some bugs, and the instructions are over my head at this point [EDIT: not anymore–see wiki link above]. But the basics are there now for people who know how to use them. Once the bugs are worked out, I plan to simplify the instructions for everyone’s use. Maybe even offer microSD cards with everything pre-installed. [EDIT: this plan is off my agenda for the time being.]</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>
