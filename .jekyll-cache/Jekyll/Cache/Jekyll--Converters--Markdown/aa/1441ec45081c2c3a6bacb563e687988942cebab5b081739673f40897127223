I"+<p>The following registration form, menu, and list of things to bring help one prepare for a retreat. Whether retreating at home or at a center, I suggest you read it and fill out the questionnaire to help you prepare mentally for the retreat. Likewise, give it to those whose retreats you support.</p>

<p>Marion Abbott amassed a <a href="http://darknessretreats.wordpress.com">long list of centers</a> at her new blog about darkroom retreating. She also <a href="https://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=2075542">mapped them</a>. Most are spiritual or therapeutic centers, but some will support a hygienic retreat if you know what to ask for and what you are doing. More centers appear each year. The world capital is Czech Republic, with 20 centers and 50 darkrooms for 10 million people (600 times more than America, for example).</p>

</ul>

<h5 id="guide">guide</h5>

<p>Most of the time, just eat plain fruit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eat one fruit until you lose your taste for it</li>
  <li>if still hungry, switch to another</li>
  <li>start with the most watery (melons) foods, end with the least (bananas, dates)</li>
  <li>eat greens anytime</li>
</ul>

<p>Some days, have a yummy recipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sweet green salads (midday or evenings)
    <ul>
      <li>melon
        <ul>
          <li>1 head romaine, chopped</li>
          <li>2 L watermelon, chopped (only combine one kind of melon with one green, otherwise stomach ache)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>banana
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 head romaine, chopped</li>
          <li>3 ribs celery, finely chopped</li>
          <li>4 bananas, ripe</li>
          <li>1 L strawberries or blueberries or chopped nectarines</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>citrus
        <ul>
          <li>1 head romaine, chopped</li>
          <li>5 sprigs parsley</li>
          <li>3 oranges, peeled, sectioned, cut in half</li>
          <li>2 apples, chopped</li>
          <li>2 slices pineapple, chopped</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>savory salads (evenings)
    <ul>
      <li>tomato
        <ul>
          <li>1 head romaine, chopped</li>
          <li>3 ribs celery, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1dL rocket lettuce</li>
          <li>1 orange, chopped very finely (into pulp)</li>
          <li>5dL tomato, chopped</li>
          <li>1/2 avocado or 1dL olives</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>dry
        <ul>
          <li>1 head romaine, chopped</li>
          <li>10 sprigs parsley or cilantro</li>
          <li>1 orange, chopped very finely</li>
          <li>2 red bell pepper, chopped finely</li>
          <li>2dL mushrooms OR zuchinni, chopped</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Come up with your own based on above patterns. No more than 6 ingredients per recipe. The trick with savory salads (and all combined food, really) is to include these 8 flavors and textures in varying proportions in each dish:</p>

<p>bitter, sweet, sour, salty, savory, spicy, crunchy, fatty</p>

<ul>
  <li>bitter: tender greens like romaine and young spinach, mild culinary herbs like parsley, cilantro, and celery</li>
  <li>sweet: fruit!</li>
  <li>sour: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berries</li>
  <li>salty: celery, tomatoes</li>
  <li>savory: tomatoes, olives (rinse off oil)</li>
  <li>spicy: just a hint, barely enough to notice. Spicy greens are best, like rocket, arugala, mustard, cilantro</li>
  <li>crunchy: celery, apple</li>
  <li>fatty
    <ul>
      <li>with sufficient chewing, oiliness of lettuce is usually enough</li>
      <li>tricky because it is surprisingly easy to overeat fat
        <ul>
          <li>eat only one kind of fatty food per day</li>
          <li>eat a small quantity once per 2-4 days: 1/2 avocado, 15 olives</li>
          <li>stick mostly to fatty fruits like avocado and olives (rinse off oil). Eat nuts or seeds only 1-2 times/month</li>
          <li>eat 5-6% of your daily calories from fat, no more than 10%. Track your calories for a week at <a href="https://fitday.com">fitday.com</a>. It’s very surprising.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Just say no to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ferments, like vinegar (the second stage of fermentation beyond alcohol and even more toxic. It’s a digestive disaster.)</li>
  <li>onions, garlic, ginger</li>
  <li>spices or salt</li>
  <li>fractured foods like juice, oil, dried food</li>
  <li>nuts, seeds</li>
</ul>

<p>These imbalance, overload, or destroy digestive chemistry, bacteria, and enzymes. The good things you hear about vinegar, garlic, and ginger are hype.</p>
