I"÷<p>On the metaphysics of self-preservation: â€œConsciousness, for those organisms which possess it, is the basic means of survival.â€ â€“Ayn Rand</p>

<p>This idea is one of the roots of <em>the darkness conjecture</em>. Our lives are so thoroughly screwed up because our consciousnesses is comprehensively impaired.</p>

<p>Generally, we try to use willâ€”the most delicate part of the very faculty that is so damagedâ€”to fix our problems. How is it working out for us? As a designer of the Los Angeles freeway system would later put it, â€œEach and every problem we face today is the direct and inevitable result of yesterdayâ€™s brilliant solutions.â€ If I were the left hand, Iâ€™d say the right handâ€™s bluffing.</p>

<p>Which is why I think it would be better to use will to provide the organism, including consciousness, the conditions it needs to heal <em>itself</em> autonomically, to do with ourselves as Rockefeller did with his company: â€œAll I did was hire people who were smarter than me.â€</p>
