<p>The Master doesnâ€™t try to be powerful;<br />
thus he is truly powerful.<br />
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;<br />
thus he never has enough.</p>

<p>The Master does nothing,<br />
yet he leaves nothing undone.<br />
The ordinary man is always doing things,<br />
yet many more are left to be done.</p>

<p>The kind man does something,<br />
yet something remains undone.<br />
The just man does something,<br />
and leaves many things to be done.<br />
The moral man does something,<br />
and when no one responds<br />
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.</p>

<p><em>When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.</em><br />
<em>When goodness is lost, there is morality.</em><br />
<em>When morality is lost, there is ritual.</em><br />
Ritual is the husk of true faith,<br />
the beginning of chaos.</p>

<p>Therefore the Master concerns himself<br />
with the depths and not the surface,<br />
with the fruit and not the flower.<br />
He has no will of his own.<br />
He dwells in reality,<br />
and lets all illusions go.</p>
