I"í<p>For four years, I have been trying to do a 14-day retreat. I thought short retreats were of little value, that a long retreat was the only action that mattered. But a room good for 14-day retreats is harder to set up than one for 4- or 8-day retreats. In my dysfunction, it was too big a leap for me, like trying to jump across a wide river. In my <a href="http://andrewdurham.com/2x2">last retreat</a>, I discovered my first stepping stone.</p>

<p>With this retreat, the conjecture has become a hypothesis for me. The principal obstacle to human function and happiness is obviously psychic trauma, and dark retreating really works in healing from it. Iâ€™m not out of the woods yet, but this is definitely a clearing.</p>

<p>This book closes the first phase of practical effort that began four years ago Christmas morning. Once it is published, I will tour with it to generate more interest in dark retreating as well as more income and stability for myself. Then a longer retreat will become possible.</p>

<p>For the second phase, we will make a documentary about my investigation, focusing on my discovery of darkness. It will climax with the 14-day retreat and show the aftermath.</p>

<p>In its theme of reckless uncompromise, it will echo the story of another extreme seeker, Christopher McCandless (of <em>Into the Wild</em>). He also wanted to find a way to break out of our sick conditioning and live a real human life. I want to show what becomes of such a person who lives to share his findings.</p>
