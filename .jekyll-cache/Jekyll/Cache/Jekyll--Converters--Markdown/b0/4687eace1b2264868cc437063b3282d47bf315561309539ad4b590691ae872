I"£<p>If you already have a bathroom and kitchen you can darken easily or mostly, and you can get to it, at least with a blindfold, great. If not, make the quick, cheap, portable fixtures below. If basic versions are too punk rock for you, try the upgrades. You can incrementally improve them as you find out for yourself the value of retreating.</p>

<h4 id="sink">sink</h4>

<h5 id="basic">basic</h5>

  <li>wash hands or food</li>
  <li>slide lid off bucket to drain water into bucket</li>
  <li>putting food waste in the bucket helps keep the smell down</li>

<h4 id="toilet">toilet</h4>

<h5 id="basic-1">basic</h5>

<p>It‚Äôs a 20L bucket with a toilet seat on top. No kidding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>put 2 liters of sawdust in the bottom</li>
  <li>put 15 liters more sawdust in another bucket by the toilet</li>
  <li>with a scoop, put a 0.5L of sawdust in toilet after each use</li>

  <li>dispose of in a covered compost pile:
    <ul>
      <li>include food scraps</li>
      <li>alternate with layers of carbonaceous material like leaves, straw, sawdust</li>
      <li>let it sit for a year before use</li>
      <li>cover with dirt and plenty of carbonaceous material</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>replace toilet paper with water to ensure cleanliness and prevent abrasion and infection
    <ul>

      <li>hold upside down, with lid against lower back</li>
      <li>squeeze to get a small stream of water that runs straight down crack over anus</li>
      <li>wet fingers of free hand and wash anus</li>
      <li>wonder how you ever accomplished this task any other way</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A 20L bucket sits inside a box with a hole in the top. The return duct attaches to a hole in the side of the box. So all air exits the room through the toilet, containing all odor. Bucket also collects pee, so empty it every 3-5 days. Making a vented urinal or a toilet that separates pee from poop is possible, too.</p>

<p>Overall dimensions: 35cmH x 60W x 60D</p>

      <li>platform made of 15‚Äì20 tongue and groove boards or 12‚Äì20 plywood</li>
      <li>front and back boards, ~24 x 36, go under platform to fit on top of front and back frame pieces and between frame legs</li>

<h4 id="bath">bath</h4>

<h5 id="basic-2">basic</h5>

<p>A washcloth or sponge for a sponge bath</p>

<h5 id="upgrade-2">upgrade</h5>

<ul>
  <li>on waterproof floor (or covered with large plastic sheet) make a 2m diameter border of towels and sit in the middle</li>

<p><a href="/img/plan/shower.pdf"><img src="/img/plan/image/shower.png" alt="plan: shower" /></a></p>

<p>¬†</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a simple shower which collapses for storage, requiring no pipes and little water. Parts from top to bottom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hook (in ceiling, 50mm)</li>
  <li>bucket or bottle (4-8L, hangs from hook by handle)</li>
  <li>siphon tube (polyethylene, 4mm ID x 50cm, bent near its middle with heat to hook over rim of container)</li>
  <li>4 cords (hung from hook, tied to curtain rod)</li>
  <li>curtain rod (common irrigation tubing, black polyethylene, 30mm OD, circular, 375cm long for 120cm diameter, dowel inside ends for smooth joint)</li>
  <li>curtain (polyester or plastic sheeting, with 15cm sleeve for rod (as shown) or grommets and rings, 5cm bottom hem with small river rocks inside to weigh it down)</li>
  <li><strong>x</strong>=holes in curtain for cords to tie around curtain rod</li>
  <li>large tub (90L+, from garden supply store, catches everything at the bottom. Could also be a large, deep tray or pan.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Solar water heating method: use clear 4-8L drinking water bottles with rectangles of black plastic sheeting inside to act as elements. Have supporter give it to you when hot. Or, with dark clothing and sleeping mask on tight, grab it from a sunny spot.</p>

<p>Adjust water temperature with cold water to suit yourself. When ready to bathe, suck on the tube to start the siphon action. Water flows for eight minutes. Not bad. Dump used water into a 20L bucket with a lid for later disposal.</p>

<p>Adjust shower length and water flow with different size containers and tubes. Make sure hook can hold the weight.</p>
