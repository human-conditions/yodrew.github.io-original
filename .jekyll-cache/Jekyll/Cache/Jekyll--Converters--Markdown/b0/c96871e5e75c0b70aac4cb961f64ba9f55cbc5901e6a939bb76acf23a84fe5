<p>For their simplicity, ease, economy, strength, beauty, and elegance,
I recommend the following designs/methods for shelter construction.
(Speed measured in hours, days, weeks):</p>

Chuck Henderson‚Äôs sweeping, simple, brilliant, circled-square construction</p>

Vinay Gupta‚Äôs 3-hour, $200, portable pop-up shelter + autonomous infrastructure</p>

Nadir Khalili‚Äôs giant upside down coil pot shelters elegantly made from war materials</p>

<p><a href="http://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com/355#355">Straw Bale Dome</a> (weeks)<br />
my design for a frameless, superinsulated, catenary, corbelled, <em>cheap</em> shelter, based on superadobe</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cccoe.net/stars/">Cardboard Geodesic Dome</a> (days)<br />
I started work on improving this. See pics of Seattle and Sweden Domes <a href="http://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>The above designs are all <strong>shell</strong> constructions. That is, they are frameless. Why? Because frames should not be used to hold up materials that can hold up themselves. That approach has no integrity. It doesn‚Äôt respect the nature of the materials. One puts up a frame, then hang on it a rigid or semi-rigid material which can hold up itself and the whole building. Now, this approach <em>does</em> have the advantages of requiring no imagination or economy on the part of the owner, builder, or designer. I have chosen frameless designs that embody: a dynamic elegance bordering on anti-gravity; simplicity any 5 year-old can grasp; and an economy any schmuck can achieve.</p>

<p>The two designs below are proper applications of the frame-and-skin method of construction. That is, a very lightweight frame supports fabric or film that cannot hold itself up. It is a thin, flexible material possessing only tensile, not compressive strength (nor their combination: cantileverage).</p>

Jay Baldwin‚Äôs perfection of Bucky‚Äôs Skybreak concept: a very light, ‚Äúephemeralized‚Äù frame-and-skin geodesic dome, with panels of noble gas-inflated fluoropolymeric (teflon/ptfe plastic) pillows. This ultimately led to the gigantic greenhouses at <a href="http://www.lookaroundcornwall.com/gardens-and-nature/the-eden-project.htm">The Eden Project</a> in England.  Inflatability minimizes the frame.</p>

Jack Stephenson‚Äôs masterful 2-5 person tents. He and his designs have had a huge influence on all my design thinking since 1995. Can you imagine, he went from being an insulation engineer on space rockets to designing camping gear! After 40 years, his stuff is stillt decades ahead of its time. Only a few of his ideas have started to be copied in the last 5-10 years. I used to talk to him for hours on the phone while buying his gear and materials. Great guy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.efn.org/~finnpo/ebr/">EarthBirth Research</a><br />
Finn Po‚Äôs site on his multifarious, irrepressible, transcounter-cultural activities and visions. I got my first experiences with both darkness and domes from Finn while living and tinkering together at Maitreya Eco-Village, Eugene, Oregon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.efn.org/~wolfe">Tribal Wish</a><br />
Adrian Wolfe‚Äôs obscure but large collection of essays on his 30-year quest to live in organic intimacy with others. This effort evolved into Gooble Dell, his home (and mine a few times in the past) in Eugene, Oregon. It‚Äôs one of the oddest human menageries around. If Willy Wonka were a homeless man who camped inside a house inside a public park with his friends and a couple Oompa Loompas, this would be the house.</p>
