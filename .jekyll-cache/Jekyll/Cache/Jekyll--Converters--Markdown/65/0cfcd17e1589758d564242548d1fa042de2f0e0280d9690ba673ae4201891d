I"<p>Join the dolphin economy: I help you help me help youâ€¦</p>

<p>Here is how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply
    <ul>
      <li>darken your room</li>
      <li>retreat according to this method at home or at a center</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>interact
    <ul>
      <li>send me a question or comment</li>
      <li>buy this book after reading it if not before and you find it useful</li>
      <li>report your experience online with photos and send me the link</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>engage
    <ul>
      <li>tell me about spelling and grammatical errors you find in the book</li>
      <li>improve the website</li>
      <li>improve the method and designs; see below</li>
      <li>publish the book; see <a href="/about/license">license</a></li>
      <li>invite me to speak at an event</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>further
    <ul>
      <li>help me organize a retreat so I can heal from my own psychosis</li>
      <li>do something not listed above, perhaps what only you know about or that we could develop together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More regarding improvements:</p>

<p>If you find a theoretical or practical error in the approach, or a way to improve it, please let me know. I am happy to alter the book if your proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>presents a rational argument</li>
  <li>remains consonant with hygienic principles</li>
  <li>includes clear reports of your own reproducible experiments with the current method</li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, I would like to work with you in any way to develop hygienic darkroom retreating and advance its cause as long as you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have read my book</li>
  <li>demonstrate understanding of its basic ideas</li>
  <li>have done a retreat according to my protocol and are convinced of the value of my approach</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers.</p>
