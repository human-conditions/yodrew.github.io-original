#### five cranial supernovas

These are the five most important books and authors I have ever read. Each has blown my mind, changed my life, and deeply informed and influenced my methods and thinking since I first read it.

#### notes

I read and liked nearly everything else by Rand, Liedloff, and Quinn. There was nothing I strongly disliked.

Ouspensky's other books don't attract me. But Fritz Peters's books about Gurdjieff are great. 

I have just started to study Graham. I sought his crystalline book on diet for over 20 years. His book also stands for Herbert Shelton's masterful work on hygiene, [_Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene_](/nhs.pdf).

An honorable mention goes to _Introduction to Human Technology_ by <a href="/blog/2009/08/william-arthur-evans/">William Arthur Evans</a>. It was a highly catalytic book that came at a critical moment in late 2006. It is a rare book, discovered by my friend, Sterling.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452287081?tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;adid=1CKF7AZ7XHPKT5B97ZD5&amp;">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a> by John Perkins concretely sums up for me the diabolical process of this culture. It enabled me to finally wash my hands of trying to remediate it, at least in ordinary ways.

[Our Universal Journey](/f/journey.pdf) by George Kavassilas is a strange and fulfilling book about ontology and the soul. I found the style difficult but the ideas astounding.

[Total Onslaught]() by Walter Veith is a 50-hour video series about "The Great Controversy" between Christ and Satan. It presents the Bible coherently. Veith exposes the the light and dark forces in the world throughout history, up to the present. 

#### youth

A few other books really affected me when I was first reading things on my own, starting at age 15. They prepared me for the books above. They are so close to me, it is hard to assess their monumentality, their greatness. Also, they are so central to my thinking, it is hard to objectify them, to separate them from my perspective as I have done in the above list. They are:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312141378?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312141378">Summerhill</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0312141378" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> -A S Neill. This is about a free school in England. Neill was its wise headmaster. He believed in the rights of children and their original goodness. Which his school, still going today, proves. From my parents' shelf. It influenced the teachers of my first school, Horizons.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525243291?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0525243291">Magical Child Matures</a> -Joseph Chilton Pearce. This is about developmental psychology, a radical critique of our society, and an attitude toward a way out. From my dad's second wife.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140094296?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0140094296">The Songlines</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0140094296" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> -Bruce Chatwin. A paean to the aboriginal worldview and the virtues of walking. From my mother.  
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0818000074?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0818000074">The Natural House.</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0818000074" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> -Frank Lloyd Wright. A coherent vision of shelter and the individual. By the hero of my father, who went to Wright's school.  
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099427869?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0099427869">Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0099427869" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> -Richard Bach. A fool finds a friend and becomes wise. The book gently exposes conventional assumptions. From my brother's shelf.

#### childhood

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394404289?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0394404289">The Prophet</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0394404289" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> -Khalil Gibran. My first book of wisdom, from my mother.  
_The Dark is Rising_ - Susan Cooper. Haunting, quiet imagery. A boy hero seeks out talismans he'll need to face down a world-menacing force.  
_Farmer Boy_ - Laura Ingalls Wilder. Pure American decency and virtue, read to us by my father.  
_James and the Giant Peach, Danny the Champion of the World, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six Others_ - Roald Dahl. Dahl unchains children in his stories and in the visions of his readers. _James_ was read to us at Horizons School. My parents bought me the rest. Of course, everyone saw _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ with Gene Wilder from 1971. The book is good. But avoid the creepy new version.
