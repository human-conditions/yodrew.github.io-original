[Guatemala](http://dark-retreats.com): Kaivalya. I built the first darkroom in San Marcos, ran it, sold it. It got sold yet again to these folks. They remodeled. They then built their own facility and moved out of the one I built. They seem cool and reliable. Fairly cheap.

[Mexico](http://hridaya-yoga.com): Hridaya. A friend is retreating there now; write me for report. Cheap.

[Thailand1](www.universal-tao.com/dark_room): Tao Garden, Mantak Chia's place. Hygienic retreats not supported, just Taoist ones. I include it because Chia let a lot of us know about darkness. And I have heard good things about Chia and the place. Medium price.

[Thailand2](www.phanganearthworks.com/darkroom.html): Phangan. From reports, this place seriously needs a ventilation upgrade. Owners were cool and friendly in emails. Cheap.

[Italy](http://www.darkroom432hz.net/2014): Darkroom 432Hz. High tech (interesting idea behind it) but gourmet and with shared spaces, so unhygienic and expensive. Maybe they would support a hygienic retreat. I don't know them.

[Slovakia](http://www.zivica.sk/sk/vzdelavacie-centrum/ustranie-v-tme): Zivica. Seems ok. Friendly, serious people. Medium price.

[Sweden](http://www.lyfjabergt.es/welcome/home): Lyfjabergt. Seems ok. Friendly guy. Medium-high price.

My new friend, Marion Abbott, is keeping good track of this, amassing a [long list of centers](http://darknessretreats.wordpress.com) at her new blog about darkroom retreating.
