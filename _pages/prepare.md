The following questionnaire, menu, and list of things to bring will help you prepare for a retreat. The form will help you prepare mentally for the retreat. Later, if you support retreats for others, give it to them.

Someday, there will be centers that support hygienic darkroom retreats. For now, just do it yourself. Use your home, a friend or relative's place, or vacation rental. If you want help, share the book: with a friend, in an announcement, a public talk, in a book club, in class, or at work. Sometimes it is easier to work alone, sometimes with others. I have done both, depending on my circumstances and abilities.

I am speaking of 4-day retreats, of course. Retreats of eight days and longer require help.

#### overview {#overview}

Follow instructions carefully.

1. Finish reading this book. Quiz later. &#128578;
2. Schedule your retreat. Retreats begin at 16:00 and end at 12:00 four or eight days later. For example, a 4-day retreat that begins Friday would end Tuesday. An 8-day retreat that begins Friday would end the second Saturday after. 
3. Respond to the questionnaire below. Responses of one or two sentences per question are sufficient. 
4. Gather things listed below and retreat!

##### guide  {#guide-}

Most of the time, just eat plain fruit:

- eat one fruit until you lose your taste for it
- if still hungry, switch to another
- start with the most watery (melons) foods, end with the least (bananas, dates)
- eat greens anytime

Some days, have a yummy recipe:

- sweet green salads (midday or evenings)
	- melon
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 2 L watermelon, chopped (only combine one kind of melon with one green, otherwise stomach ache)
	- banana
		- 1/2 head romaine, chopped
		- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
		- 4 bananas, ripe
		- 1 L strawberries or blueberries or chopped nectarines
	- citrus
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 5 sprigs parsley
		- 3 oranges, peeled, sectioned, cut in half
		- 2 apples, chopped
		- 2 slices pineapple, chopped
- savory salads (evenings)
	- tomato
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
		- 1dL rocket lettuce
		- 1 orange, chopped very finely (into pulp)
		- 5dL tomato, chopped
		- 1/2 avocado or 1dL olives
	- dry
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 10 sprigs parsley or cilantro
		- 1 orange, chopped very finely 
		- 2 red bell pepper, chopped finely
		- 2dL mushrooms OR zuchinni, chopped

Come up with your own based on above patterns. No more than 6 ingredients per recipe. The trick to making yummy savory salads is to include these 8 flavors and textures in varying proportions in each dish:

bitter, sweet, sour, salty, savory, spicy, crunchy, fatty

- bitter: tender greens like romaine and young spinach, celery, and mild culinary herbs like parsley and cilantro
- sweet: fruit!
- sour: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berries
- salty: celery, tomatoes
- savory: tomatoes, olives (rinse off oil)
- spicy: just a hint, barely enough to notice. Spicy greens are best, like rocket, arugala, mustard, cilantro
- crunchy: celery, apple
- fatty
    - with sufficient chewing, oiliness of lettuce is usually enough
    - tricky because it is surprisingly easy to overeat fat
        - eat a small quantity once per 2-4 days, eg, 1/2 avocado or 15 olives
        - eat only one kind of fatty food in a day
        - stick to fatty fruits like avocado and olives
        - eat 5-6% of your daily calories from fat, no more than 10%. Track your calories for two weeks. It's very surprising. Use nutrition tables, websites, or apps.

Just say no to: 

- ferments, like vinegar (the second stage of fermentation beyond alcohol and even more toxic. It's a digestive disaster.)
- onions, garlic, ginger
- spices or salt
- fractured foods like juice, oil, dried food
- nuts, seeds

These imbalance, overload, or destroy digestive chemistry, bacteria, and enzymes. The good things you hear about vinegar, garlic, and ginger are old wives' tales or industry-sponsored hype. 

If you would study this idea before trying it, see:

- [*darkroom-retreat > food*](/darkroom-retreat/#food-darkroom-retreat) and [*protocol > food*](/protocol/#food-protocol)
- Dr Douglas Graham's masterful  [*80/10/10 Diet*](http://foodnsport.com)
- [Loren Lockman's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/LorenLockman)
- [*Science and Fine Art of Food and Nutrition (Orthotrophy)*](/f/fnhs.pdf) by Herbert Shelton. This book devastates convention. You'll never look at prepared food the same way again.

If eating frugivorously during your retreat is too much to deal with, eat as simply and naturally as you know how. Give more attention to it later when your motivation and capacity increase.
