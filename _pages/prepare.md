The following registration form, menu, and list of things to bring help one prepare for a retreat. Whether retreating at home or at a center, I suggest you read it and fill out the questionnaire to help you prepare mentally for the retreat. Likewise, give it to those whose retreats you support.

Marion Abbott amassed a [long list of centers](http://darknessretreats.wordpress.com) at her new blog about darkroom retreating. She also [mapped them](https://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=2075542). Most are spiritual or therapeutic centers, but some will support a hygienic retreat if you know what to ask for and what you are doing. More centers appear each year.

#### menu

##### summary

- 3L pure water per day
- frugivorous menu
    - fruit: whole, raw, ripe, in season, well-washed, ample for eating anytime
    - tender leafy greens: romaine, escarole, young spinach
	- green salad: sweet or savory, large, properly combined, served at midday or evening
	- treats: 1 smoothie per 4 days, 1/2 avocado or 15 olives per 2 days in salads
    - no: ferments (eg, vinegar), onions, garlic, ginger, spices, salt, juice, oil, dried food, nuts or seeds

##### guide 

Most of the time, just eat plain fruit. 
	- eat one fruit until you lose your taste for it
	- if still hungry, switch to another
	- eat from the most watery (melons) to the least (bananas, dates)

Some days, have a yummy recipe:

- sweet green salads (midday or evenings)
	- melon
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 2 L watermelon, chopped (only combine one kind of melon with one green, otherwise stomach ache)
	- banana
		- 1/2 head romaine, chopped
		- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
		- 4 bananas, ripe
		- 1 L strawberries or blueberries or chopped nectarines
	- citrus
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 5 sprigs parsley
		- 3 oranges, peeled, sectioned, cut in half
		- 2 apples, chopped
		- 2 slices pineapple, chopped
- savory salads (evenings)
	- tomato
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
		- 1dL rocket lettuce
		- 1 orange, chopped very finely (into pulp)
		- 5dL tomato, chopped
		- 1/2 avocado or 1dL olives
	- dry
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 10 sprigs parsley or cilantro
		- 1 orange, chopped very finely 
		- 2 red bell pepper, chopped finely
		- 2dL mushrooms OR zuchinni, chopped

Come up with your own based on above patterns. No more than 6 ingredients per recipe. The trick with savory salads (and all combined food, really) is to make sure the 8 main flavors/textures are present in varying proportions:

bitter, sweet, sour, salty, savory, spicy, crunchy, fatty

- bitter: tender greens like romaine and young spinach, mild culinary herbs like parsley, cilantro. Also celery
- sweet: fruit!
- sour: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berries
- salty: celery, tomatoes (especially dried)
- savory: tomatoes, olives (rinse off oil)
- spicy: hot, but just a hint, barely enough to notice. Spicy greens are best, like rocket, arugala, mustard, cilantro
- crunchy: lots of things
- fatty
	- tricky because it is surprisingly easy to overeat fat
	- with sufficient chewing, oiliness of lettuce is usually enough
	- eat only one kind of fatty food at a time
	- eat a small quantity once per 2-4 days: 1/2 avocado, 15 olives
	- stick mostly to fruits, avocado and olives (rinse off oil). Eat nuts or seeds only 1-2 times/month
	- eat no more than 10% of your daily calories from fat. 5-6% is best. Look up calories for a week to learn this at [fitday.com](https://fitday.com).

no: 
- ferments, like vinegar (the second stage of fermentation beyond alcohol and even more toxic. It's a digestive disaster.)
- onions, garlic, ginger
- spices or salt
- fractured foods like juice, oil, dried food
- nuts, seeds

These imbalance, overload, or destroy digestive chemistry, bacteria, and enzymes. The good things you hear about vinegar, garlic, and ginger are hype.

If you would like to know more about this menu before trying it, see:

- [*darkroom-retreat > food*](/darkroom-retreat#food-darkroom-retreat) and [*protocol > food*](/protocol#food-protocol)
- Dr Douglas Graham's masterful  [*The 80/10/10 Diet*](http://foodnsport.com)
- [Loren Lockman's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/LorenLockman)

If you somehow cannot eat this way, eat as simply and naturally as you know how. For suggestions, write me with your limitations.
