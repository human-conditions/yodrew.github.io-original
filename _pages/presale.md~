I believe joy is natural. Through investigation, I discovered the essential condition nature gives us to reverse the cause of our suffering and restore joy: darkness. With hygiene, the science of health, I developed a model⁠ for using darkness. It is called _hygienic darkroom retreating_. It  to produce reliable miracles

- relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness
- natural healing from major trauma, the cause of human suffering and problems
- recovery of the lost self
- restoration of personal power

My readers and I have glimpsed these benefits in our preliminary retreats. To realize them fully requires a self-supporting, organized team. Therefore...

#### startup

I am starting a business. To fund it, I am pre-selling everything I plan to offer:

#### goal

$8400, staged up from $2200 minimum. Stages reflect priorities. Costs include manufacturing, credit redemptions, expenses, and debts.

| Stage | Item                                    | Price | Costs | Goals |
| -----:| ----------------------------------------| -----:| ----: | -----:|     
|     1 | hygienic computer                       |  1000 |  1200 |  2200 |     
|     2 | legal counsel for forming business      |  1000 |  1200 |  4400 |     
|     3 | assembly drawings for book              |  1000 |  1200 |  6600 |     
|     4 | copy editing, proofreading, book design |   800 |  1000 |  8400 |     

#### plan

1. launch presale
    - find members of my network to share presale with their networks
    - reach first goal
    - buy computer
    - update and expand promotion of presale
2. edit book
    - integrate final pieces of model
    - refine organization of book content
    - simplify sentence style and structure for clarity, easier reading and translation (grueling work)
    - get book copyedited, proofread, and designed
    - assembly drawings may come in the next edition or as a separate book
    - print and ship on schedule
3. develop business
    - study the startup process 
    - create pitch deck and other documents to design the business
    - use documents to attract funding and team and begin organizing work
4. components: 
    - develop production processes and tooling
    - refine recent prototypes
    - produce and ship components on schedule
5. misc
    - lecture: 
         - refine existing talk according to model
         - make offers to speak in public
    - begin prototyping darkroom
    - seminar: plan and organize
            
#### risks and qualifications

I could print the current version of the book right now and ship it. I have done so many times. It has 98% of the content I want it to have when it ships in four months. I have tested the revisions I plans

I have produced or at least prototyped everything else in the list except where noted. I have shipped things internationally from both America and Europe. 

I grew up around the small businesses of my father, extended family, friends, and townspeople. I worked closely with entrepreneurs, read business books my whole life, and have done business consulting. I know double-entry accounting, spreadsheets, simple programming, basic law, the military attitude, history, and philosophy.

The biggest risk is if the world ends. I don't think it will. Things are getting hairy. I'm a survivor. I'll find a way to fill your order using my unique set of skills.

The worst case scenario is if hygienic darkroom retreating doesn't happen because people don't try. It is my function in life, so I am going to keep at it.

#### conclusion

Thanks for your consideration and support.
