This month, I figured out:

1. The first phase of development of hygienic darkroom retreating (hdr) is finished
2. The reason why I have failed to do a 20-day retreat all this time
3. I must tell people my work is mature and needs capitalization: team, money, organization, etc

Now I will explain these.

1. First phase

I developed short retreats over 11 years. I had work alone to establish basic principles. On this foundation, we should be able to develop medium and long retreats faster and more easily.

Development ended this autumn when I found three things:

- last pieces of the method
    - air filtration
    - bed design
    - the infinite nature of the self (thanks to George Kavassilas). we have some access now to the deep self we will completely recover in darkness
- method as a whole
    - importance of and high standards necessary for all pieces. I tried for years to get by on quick, cheap solutions. That was fine for testing. But for full application, everything needs serious attention.
    - how they all work together:
        - darkroom
        - retreatant
        - supporters
- place of method in the world
    - humanity has huge potential
        - the hygienic use of darkness has political implications. By recovering wholeness, we recover personal power, the basis of freedom.
        - we need to pull ourselves together to deal with huge changes predicted for Earth in the near future 
    - malevolent forces oppose us
        - ruled by deception and force, we begin at a disadvantage
        - we are each damaged and conditioned as slaves
    
It has been a strange six months. I had worked for 11 years like a juggernaut. My momentum blinded me to the fact that I was reaching the end. Somehow, I had to slow down and reorient. I subconsciously arranged the theft of my computer, the destruction of my smartphone, and recently, getting defrauded of a significant amount of money. It was shocking and discouraging. But it got me to stop. 

After my computer was stolen, I read George's book (darkroomretreat.com/f/journey.pdf). That helped a lot. I did one more retreat. It was a failure, but I found the last pieces there.

2. Failure to retreat

During these months of reflection, I figured out the answers to my dreadful questions:

- Why have I failed to retreat for 20-days, as I have intended for all these years?
- If hygienic darkroom retreating is so great, why am I still unwell?

I have failed because a 20-day retreat requires a fully developed method, a trained team, and an excellent darkroom. None of these existed yet. Even now, the method is still only in my head, not fully in my book yet.

The greatness of hygienic darkroom retreating has only been potential, not actual. I have always seen it. But until it is realized, I cannot apply it fully and heal. 

One might think I would have at least not gotten worse. But two other factors blocked me.

- A retreat long enough to heal requires a team. But I could not work with others at first. I am too vulnerable to the influence of others. This due to the same sensitivity that enabled me to discover darkness. I could not protect the vision I had from others. I had to work alone till it was stable in my mind. Now, I can still be hurt, but the method cannot be. Meanwhile, my exhaustion intensified. 
- I hurt myself with too many 4-day retreats. I did not know their danger. Doing a couple 4-day retreats is fine. But I did 15! They strip a person of artificial survival skills. Normal capacity replaces these in darkness, but this takes at least an 8-day retreat. See darkroomretreat.com/hygiene#false-capacity and darkroomretreat.com/format#warning for more.

    A 4-day retreat was enough to glimpse the potential of darkness. To get relief and begin healing. To develop the method. So I kept going. But the cost has been very great. Some days, I cling to life. This is tragic and frightening. I hope I have a chance to recover.

    I should be in a hospital. But the hospital I need does not exist. It must be organized, funded, designed, and built. The staff must be trained. I will have to be nursed back to health. In the meantime, I must hang on. Once I have retreated, I will be stable and able to handle things normally. 

3. Capitalization

As I said, this means a team, money, organization, facility, a home for me, etc. Everything necessary to realize a project. I am not so great at this. Which is why even the organization of the capitalization needs help. I am just the eccentric guy with the idea. That's what I can give. 

It does happen to be the greatest idea in history, with commensurate benefits. In substandard form, it has saved my life twice. Perfected, it can save everyone and everything and make our dreams come true. We will make it perfect.

Among other things, I studied business and organizations. But I am no master at them. I don't know the details. Others must lead that part of it, and I will be happy to cooperate.

Everything directly to do with the method itself has to be done my way. In some ways, this will affect how the organization operates. I have some ideas, but I am more flexible about that. I will not compromise one particle of my work. And I will not fight people about it who are supposed to be helping. I will show them the door, and I will have the authority to do so.

It is essential that participants study my book, internalize its ideas, experience darkness my way, see what I have seen, come to believe in it, and make it their own as I have. The truth I have found is objective. Anyone can know it for himself. But only if he reads the manual and follows the instructions. As my mentor, DeWaynn used to say, there is no penalty for that.

When I am better and we are all more experienced, the situation can relax and roles can overlap. Expect some rigidity until then. We have to keep things straight till they can keep themselves straight. As I believe they will. This is a living thing. It is natural. Like walking and talking, it must be learned. Then it can fairly go on by itself.
