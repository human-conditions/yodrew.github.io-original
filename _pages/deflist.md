*** This is a list
  * Sub item 1
  * Sub item 2

*** Next list item. We can also nest code:

**      def foo
        "hello!"
      end

**  ... and continue writing. This still is part of the list item.

**
Also works for definition lists, but is tricky.**: ^

**  * Foo
  * Bar
  
  Still part of the definition description. What?

**

**hygiene**: the science of health, a branch of biology. Also, the philosophy of hygienism<!-- hygienics? -->; caring for health by respecting life's self-preserving nature and providing its normal conditions. Also, Natural Hygiene

**Natural Hygiene**: the 185 year-old school of health that champions and exemplifies hygiene 

**normal**: what is biologically appropriate (not merely usual or average)  

**psyche**: the faculty of consciousness, including:

	- forms: related intelligences
		- sensation: physical / moving / instinctive
		- perception: emotional / feeling / intuitive
		- conception: mental / thinking / intellectual 
	- parts
		- unconscious: autonomic processes which cannot be made conscious (short of intense yogic practices), like regulating cell division or blood oxygen levels
		- subconscious: acquired automatized knowledge, which can be made conscious, like cognizing words or walking
		- conscious: ordinary waking awareness, as when reading this book or running an errand
	- scales
		- cells
		- organs
		- systems
		- the organism as a whole
	
**psychic**: of or relating to the psyche in general (not occult powers). 
  For example, I refer to psychic illness rather than "mental" illness. Psychology is not just the study of the mind, but the psyche: the entire faculty of human consciousness. This includes emotional and physical aspects not reducible to the mental one.  

**lifeway**: a way of life; everything that happens with people in a given group in the course of living. 
  I once used the word, culture, for this. Then I learned culture is recent: an invention of civilization. I wanted a bigger word which would include all approaches to human existence. Lifeway is a nicely compressed term common in anthropology.
