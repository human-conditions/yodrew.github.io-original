#### intro

I am starting a business to advance hygienic darkroom retreating. To fund it, I am pre-selling everything I describe in my book: 

- information: my book in paperback, lectures, training
- services: consultations, retreats, gift certificates
- goods: darkroom components, darkrooms, neighborhoods, microfactories

The hygienic use of darkness results in:

- relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness
- natural healing from major trauma, the cause of human suffering and problems
- recovery of the lost self
- restoration of personal power

My readers and I have gained these benefits to noticeable degrees in our preliminary retreats. To realize them fully requires a self-supporting, organized team. Now that development of the model is complete, we can begin.

The unusual TERMS below recognize the assistance people have given me till now. Goods and services, their shipping dates through 2023, and prices are listed in the MENU. The ultimate GOAL of the campaign is $10,800. The minimum is $1900. The budget is described as well. The PLAN explains how I'll use the money.

#### terms

- $USD prices, postpaid 
- $Cash is base price. $Credit is price after maximum credit is applied. (Difference is the maximum credit that can be applied to each unit.)
- if you ever gave me money before, you have credit now.
    - donations and contributions to my 2016 crowdfund are credited 100%
    - leanpub purchases are credited 70%
    - credit is tranferable
    - include a mention or record of your prior contribution (eg, a leanpub order #). If you lost it, I might have it.
    - I gladly honor claims from anyone who helped me in any way since my R&D began 32 years ago
    - see a list of credits at [future webpage]. Look for yours by your initials, year, and country code where you were at the time. If you don't see it, let me know.

Proper tools are essential to any worker. E-paper is radically humane technology. It is neutral, even calming. Laptop displays⁠—backlit, color, fast, strobing⁠— irritate, distract, and enervate me, destroying my concentration. With an e-paper computer, I can:

- hold my entire book in my mind at once while editing
- read a handful of crucial books and articles I collected since my last e-paper device died
- develop the business that creates the goods and services I will offer


With $1900, I can get the computer and begin. Money short of the ultimate goal will come from new work assignments and the startup process. A pitch deck is an extremely powerful thing.



#### plan

- business
    - study the startup process 
    - develop pitch deck and other business documents to attract funding
    - assemble team and organize work
- book
    - integrate final pieces of model 
    - refine organization of book content
    - simplify sentence style and structure for clarity, easier reading and translation (grueling work)
    - get book copyedited, proofread, and designed
    - assembly drawings may come in the next edition or as a separate book
    - print and ship on schedule
- lecture: 
    - refine existing talk according to completed model
    - make offers to speak in public
- components: 
    - develop production processes
    - design and make jigs and tooling
    - produce and ship on schedule
- begin prototyping darkroom 2020
- train retreat supporters
- seminar: plan and organize
- develop microfactory tooling
            
That's it. Thanks for your consideration and support.
