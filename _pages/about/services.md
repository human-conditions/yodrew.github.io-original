I do nearly everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating: study, experiment, write, speak, consult, design, build.  At the moment, I am not operating a darkroom or supporting retreats. For that, find darkroom retreat centers on this cool [global map](https://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=2075542).

#### writing

- Read my book free here or for $6+ from [leanpub](http://leanpub.com/darkroomretreat)
- Quote and excerpt anything in my book and website. Credit me and tell me where it will show up and I will also acknowledge and link to you on my website.
- Invite me to write for your publication on any subject related to hygienic darkroom retreating and hygienic psychology.
- Publish my book, make money. See [*license*](/about/license/)

#### speaking

Invite me to edify your audience.

(Expenses + something that fits your budget. Causes I believe in are payment in themselves)

#### consulting

Get my advice on darkroom retreating, building darkrooms, and issues arising thereof.

($25/hr. First email is free if you have read my book.)

I will respond in detail, by email or skype, to all your questions and concerns about:

- how, where, and why to set up a darkroom
- how to organize a retreat with a supporter
- how to deal with specific issues you have personal and about retreating itself

My responses will be based on my experience. Over the past 13 years, I have:

- done 27 retreats from 2-7 days long
- facilitated 30 retreats for others
- designed and built or upgraded 28 working darkrooms, operating three of them, consulting remotely on three more, all in five climates on four continents 
- written 200,000 words about darkroom retreating for web, email, and print
- given 14 public talks

#### design

Have me design your darkroom from scratch or in an existing building

($25/hr + materials, travel, and shelter)

See my [hygienic house](/plan) for my latest thinking.
