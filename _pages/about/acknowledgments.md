Thanks to hundreds of people in 8 countries on 2 continents over 28 years, who morally and materially aided me during my prodigal search, especially my:

##### editors

...for heroic efforts to make this book real. In triage, you were as merciful as you could be:

- Are Solheim, writer and fellow refugee in darkness, for seeing and believing in me and the book, for visionary editing, hosting me during the rewrite, and your compassion for humanity, even me
- Magnus Vanebo, philosopher, for enthusiastically diving into the text and sensitively editing it

    Also, 
- Bertrand Besigye, outlandish poet and fellow journeyman in darkness, for early support of the book

##### family

Immediate, extended, and adopted: I leaned on all of you that would let me. It can't be easy rearing a stubborn 20, 30, then 40 year-old psychotic infant in a world that denies everything real. Thanks, especially, to:

- Brother Paul, for shelter and guidance you should never have had to give
- Grandmother Anna Lou Craig Callen Posey, always there
- Brother Francois, for constant experience of love
- Cousin Christopher, for your generosity and grit
- Uncle Jim---dropout, drug dealer, beach bum, loser, cool-ass motherfucker---for laughingly giving the system the finger till the day you died. RIP, man.

Trimurti: my second family, torn away as soon as I noticed, for helping further raise me

##### influences

...for friendship, support, and/or raising the bar so high that anti-gravity boots became necessary. And especially: 

##### elders

- Jack Nuckols: a giant and first among my elders, you took care of me till I found my way. RIP.
- Willetta Warberg: you poured your heart and soul into me through your piano, kindness, and huge personality
- John Boyer: you fed me with so much of your _time_
- Purna Steinitz: you kept your terrible promise
- DeWaynn Rogers: you helped me up and kept me from the system's clutches. RIP.
- Finn Po: elder, master job trainer, pioneer of the way of the future, you could not have done more

Each of you gave me the world.

##### old friends

- John Roberts: lifelong best friend, tremendous supporter, host
- Daniel Meulbroek: guardian, supporter, and host extraordinaire 
- Brian Riggs Sullivan: full-throttle collaborator, who gave first help in developing these ideas and, as always, trying them out yourself

##### end

I called some people here guides, but anyone who hosted me also guided me. I've needed a lot of help for a long time. Everyone on this list put a lot of time and energy into me and my work.

I also made enemies and hurt some people along the way. I'm sorry it didn't go the way we thought at first. Here's hoping it was not in vain.

Acknowledgments in books usually bore me. This one I cannot reread without weeping. Onward, then, till the task is complete.
