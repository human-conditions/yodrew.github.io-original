Welcome. This website contains my book, <em>hygienic darkroom retreat</em>, related writings, and a blog.

#### bio

Born 1971, Twin Falls, Idaho. For 21 years, I traveled America while searching for the cause of joy. I independently studied philosophy, health, and design, testing my findings by living outside, doing odd jobs, playing music, and building alternative shelter. 

In 2008, my quest culminated in _the darkness conjecture_, a concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the selfâ€‹-healing psyche. I spent the years since then proving the concept; designing and building darkrooms and supporting retreats in Guatemala, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Czech Republic; giving lectures and consulting for readers; and refining and documenting my work at [darkroomretreat.com](/). Now I am preparing to fully apply it in a 20-day retreat in order to heal from my own psychophysical illness.

#### site changelog

2019

March

Radical goings on, pushing the theory of hygiene fully over the hump to v3.0

- hygiene: organized hygiene's Laws of Life, adding _Law of Coordination_  
- psychology
    - completed the revision of the hygienic pathology
    - reordered the pathology section, demoting the traditional pathology as well as allopathy
- reinstated the old law list as an appendix
- helix vent reverted to old version with slight improvements to make it smaller and more durable. New 4-channel design was too hard to make. It could work with machines.

It just needs new drawings now.
