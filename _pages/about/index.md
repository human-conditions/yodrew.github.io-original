2019

April

- hygiene: improved Law of Force with idea of structure.
- psychology: started simplifying the style with hemingway app

March

Radical goings on, pushing the theory of hygiene fully over the hump to v3.0

- hygiene
    - organized hygiene's Laws of Life, adding _Law of Coordination_ and dividing _Great Law_ into laws _Force_ and _Proportion_.
    - reinstated the old law list as an appendix
- psychology
    - completed the revision of the hygienic pathology
    - reordered the pathology section, demoting the traditional pathology as well as allopathy
- air: helix vent reverted to old version with slight improvements to make it smaller and more durable. New 4-channel design was too hard to make. It could work with machines.

The book just needs new drawings now.
