____Underlined____ words are links to external resources. When also ____*Italicized*____, they probably link internally to other parts of the book. Their text usually indicates where. In the ebook or online, just click them. They can also be titles of downloadable books.

You needn't read this whole book just to get the idea. I present it in layers: immediately in brief, then in detail.

The book is an integrated whole. Every word contributes to understanding. It is best read cover to cover. Each section builds upon the last  including the blurb, foreword, etc.
