# laws of life

I have grouped laws by subject. Four primary laws at the beginning form an integrating basis for the rest. They correspond with axiomatic concepts in philosophy: being, identity, consciousness, and causality, the corollary of identity. They are the most important. All others follow from them. 

I substantially edited the [original list](/appendix-laws-of-life)). It was too long to remember and use. Order was random, its numbers only highlighting its length. It was verbose. It over-emphasized energy at the expense of being and identity. I split _Life's Great Law_ into the primary _Law of Life_ and the new secondary _Law of Force_; expanded the _Law of Order_; and formulated two new axiomatic laws, of _Coordination_ and _Capacity_. 

Dr Jennings went overboard with Rousseau's effusive template. Somehow, the result needs order.

- axioms
    - **Life**: _There is life._ A force inherent in organisms, called lifeforce or vital force, sustains the instinct of self-preservation in every cell of the body.
    - **Order**: Life's self-preserving nature and conditional existence are its defining characteristics. The constant practical aim of self-preservation is health, life's natural state. The organism is thus completely self-ordering, self-constructing, self-maintaining, self-directing, self-repairing, self-defending, and self-healing. Externally, it needs only its original conditions: air, warmth, water, light and darkness, food, company, etc.
    - **Coordination**: The instinct of self-preservation which coordinates all living processes is a form of consciousness. The faculty of consciousness is the psyche. Thus the psyche is the coordinating system of animals. It works mostly unconsciously. The conscious mostly serves to maintain conditions.
    - **Capacity**: Capacity determines function. Capacity is the degree of an organism's structural integrity. Function is the physical, emotional, and mental ability to live. How one is determines what one can both do and benefit from.

## secondary

### general

- **Action**: Whenever action occurs in an organism in response to external influences, the action must be ascribed to the living thing. It has the power of action, not the external thing, whose main characteristic is inertia.
- **Power**: The power used in any vital or medicinal action is vital power, that is, power from within and not from without.
- **Dual Effect**: Every action and substance has a primary effect followed by an opposite and equal secondary effect.
- **Vital Accommodation**:  The organism accommodates itself to external influences it cannot use, control, or destroy. It distributes the force of acute harm, lowering overall health.

### reserves

- **Economy**: An organism under favorable conditions stores excess vital energy and materials above the current expenditures as a "reserve fund" to be employed in time of special need. Also called the _Law of Special Economy_.
- **Repose**: When activity has expended the substance and energy of the body, rest is induced in order to replenish them. See the _Law of Dual Effect_. It is also called the _Law of Compensation_. 
- **Development**: The development of an organism is directly proportional to the amount of vital forces and nutritive materials which are available to it, thus limited by the factor in shortest supply. Integrates the _Law of the Minimum_.

#### energy

- **Force**: The success of each organism is directly proportional to the amount of its life force and inversely proportional to the degree of its activity. Also called _Life's Great Law_ when combined with the _Law of Life_.
- **Distribution**: Distribution of power is proportionate to the importance and needs of the various organs and tissues of the body.
- **Limitation**: When the expenditure of vital power has advanced so far that a fatal exhaustion is imminent, a check is put upon the unnecessary expenditure of power; the organism rebels against the further use of an accustomed stimulant.

#### material

- **Utilization**: The normal elements and materials of life are all that an organism is ever capable of constructively utilizing, whether it is well or sick. No substance or process that is not a normal factor or element in physiology can be of any value in the structure of an organism. That which is unusable in a state of health, is equally unusable in a state of illness.
- **Selectivity**: When the quality of nutriment being received by an organism is higher than that of the present living tissue, the organism will discard lower-grade cells to make room for appropriating the superior materials into new and healthy tissue. Also called the _Law of Quality Selection_.
- **Elimination**: All injurious substances which, by any means, gain admittance into an organism are counteracted, neutralized, and eliminated as fully as bodily nerve energy supply allows and by such means and through such channels as will produce the least amount of harm to living structure. Also called the _Law of Selective Elimination_.
- **Conservation**: Whenever nutritive abstinence occurs, an organism's reserves are conserved and economized. Living structures are autolyzed in the inverse order of their usefulness, while toxic substances are eliminated. This law refers to fasting; it applies to starvation as well. Also called the _Law of Autolysis_.

autonomic: acting or occurring involuntarily, without conscious control

**Life's Great Law**: Every living cell of the organized body is endowed with an instinct of self-preservation, sustained by an inherent force in the organism called "vital force" or "life force." 
**Life's Great Law**: Every cell of the body possesses the instinct of self-preservation, which is sustained by an inherent force in the organism called vital force or lifeforce. 
- **Life**: Every cell of an organism possesses the instinct of self-preservation, which is sustained by an inherent force called "vital force" or "life force."
**Force**:  
It is a force that inheres in every cell of an organism. It is called vital force or life force. It drives the instinct of self-preservation.

- **Coordination**: 

The psyche is an organism's faculty of consciousness. Consciousness includes instinct. The instinct of self-preservation directs all living processes toward the purpose of life. This  Thus the psyche is the primary system of animals. It works mostly unconsciously. The conscious mostly serves to maintain conditions.


DUAL EFFECT
 The primary immediate effect of an action or substance has a delayed, opposite and equal secondary effect upon an organism.

The secondary effect upon a living organism of any act, habit, indulgence, or agent is the exact opposite and equal of the primary effect.
Every act, habit, indulgence, or agent has a secondary effect upon an organism that is the exact opposite and equal of the primary effect.

- **Dual Effect**: The primary effect of any action or substance is followed by the exact opposite and equal secondary effect.
