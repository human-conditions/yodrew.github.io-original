You needn't read this whole book just to get the idea. I present it in layers: immediately in brief, then in detail.

The book is an integrated whole, best read front to back, cover to cover. Each section builds upon the last. Every word contributes to understanding, including the blurb, foreword, etc.

____Underlined____ words are links. 
- ____*Italicized text*____
    - most are internal links to other parts of this book. In the ebook or on the web, click. In paper, the text usually indicates a chapter and section
    - a handful are titles of downloadable books 
- ____Normal text____: external webpages
