____Underlined____ words are links to external resources. When ____*italicized*____ they link internally to other parts of the book. Their text usually indicates where. In the ebook or online, just click them.

You needn't read the whole book just to get the idea. I present it in layers: immediately in brief, then again at length, in detail, in different aspects. 

The book is best read cover to cover, starting with the blurb. Each section builds upon the last. Every word contributes to understanding, including those before and after numbered chapters.
