The book is best read cover to cover. Each section builds upon the last. Every word contributes to understanding, not just numbered chapters but, for example, the blurb and appendices. The instruction lists in the four _make_ chapters are tedious; they can wait till you use them. IKEA-like assembly instructions to come.
