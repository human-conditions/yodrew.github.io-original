#### psyche

Shelton reviews hygienic ideas about the psyche: "Graham pointed out that the 'vital instincts' behaved as though directed by intelligence. Tilden held that physiology is 'organized psychology.'"[^3] And here is Shelton's own unsentimental view: "The conscious functions of the body serve primarily to protect and provide the needs of the subconscious functions."[^4] This means consciousness is not an end in itself. It serves a biological function. Hygiene views consciousness as primarily autonomic (unconscious), secondarily volitional (conscious).

Furthermore, the psyche is the _primary_ system in the human organism. "Consciousness---for those living organisms which possess it---is the basic means of survival," as philosopher, Ayn Rand, put it in her _meta-ethics_[^5]. The psyche coordinates all other systems. It does so consciously, subconsciously, and unconsciously. The psyche is diffuse throughout the organism, functioning at every scale, autonomically monitoring and harmonizing every one of sextillions (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) of organic processes per second (trillions of cells X 1 billion processes per cell). Whatever affects the psyche for good or ill greatly affects the rest of the organism likewise.

That's a lot of work. Like any other organic system, the psyche needs a period of rest and recovery. Since its sensory apparatus is reflexive---the skin automatically feels what makes contact with it, the nose smells, the eyes see---sensory destimulation is necessary for psychic rest. Think back to the times you got your best sleep. Besides feeling at ease, your shelter was probably especially dark, well-ventilated, and quiet. While the exact circumstances at the time cannot be replicated, these critical elements can be.

#### darkness

Human beings are diurnal creatures, naturally awake in daytime and asleep at night. This physiological cycle is critical to psychic function. Modern life replaces the natural extremes of sun and stars with the relentless grey of artificial light and sunglasses. It replaces natural sleeping patterns with graveyard shifts and afterparties. This greyness, along with a hundred other civilized offences, has pushed psychic illness to epidemic proportions. Simply put, our lifeway is brutal, traumatic, damaging, and dysfunctional.

Modern distress (sensory overload, overwork, loneliness, factory food, etc) requires hundreds of millions of people to consume psychoactive drugs just to function minimally. Most dislike this dependency, which causes further distress. Caught in a vicious circle, they wonder helplessly how things will ever change. 

While many factors contribute to distress, hygienic darkroom retreating uniquely provides an _opening_: a simple way to begin reversing all of them at once. First, it harmlessly brings them to a halt. Second, it provides the being a chance to recover from them naturally, that is, by itself. Autonomically. No drugs, no therapy, no experts. _Self-healing unleashed_.

Thus, contrary to fairy tales, religion, and light bulb advertisements, darkness is a good thing. Darkness, like light, is a natural condition of life. We need nature's full provision of it---10 hours a day---in order to rest properly.

In crisis, we need an extended period of darkness to rest and recover. Darkroom retreating is to the psyche what fasting is to the body: 

- relief from sensory processing
- time to fully recover from injury, exhaustion, and toxemia
- overdue recognition of exactly which part of whom is performing the recovery

Instinct in extreme circumstances gives us a graphic clue to the basic need for darkness: when psychically overwhelmed, a person crouches down and covers her eyes, taking cover in solitude if possible. Depressed, hysterical, or shocked from violence, her whole being cries out, "Gimme shelter!". 

A darkroom is that shelter. Long sought yet right before our eyes, we couldn't see darkness. It was obscured by itself, by our Apollonian obsession with light, thought and action, and by medieval fear. Now we can finally sink into darkness, unconsciousness, and rest, and recover our lost selves.

#### hygiene revisited

Having found shelter---a context---for darkness itself in hygiene, we can better understand why darkroom retreating works. 

First, let's retrace our steps a moment and analyze Webster's sly definition of hygiene: _conditions and practices conducive to the preservation of health._

- hygiene derives from Hygieia, the Greek goddess of health. 
- "conditions and practices" refer to the normal conditions of life, the environmental and instinctive factors nature has always provided that make life, including healing, possible
- Conducive means:
    - making it easy, possible, or likely for something to happen or exist
    - tending to promote or assist
    - contributive to
- Preservation refers to an organism's preservation of itself
- Health refers to that of an organism

Thus, normal conditions support the organism in preserving its own health. Hygiene means self-preservation through providing oneself the normal conditions of life. This whole meaning hides within the dictionary's definition. Natural Hygiene, as the standard bearer of the whole tradition of hygiene, makes it explicit.

Now we can elaborate on self-preservation. It:

- is the defining characteristic of all organisms
- occurs at every scale: cells, organs, systems, and the organism as a whole
- is comprised of self-generation, self-maintenance, and self-healing

Self-healing:

- requires more work, time, and energy than self-maintenance, but less than self-generation
- includes:
    - repair of damage
    - elimination of toxins, exogenous and endogenous
    - re-energization of tissue

Consciously, we provide the conditions of life. Unconsciously, we use them in life's staggering number and variety of processes of self-preservation.

The unconscious is:

- the hidden part of consciousness. It is pervasive in the being, an integral aspect of every cell, organ, system, and the organism as a whole
- the biggest part of consciousness, coordinating millions of actions per second in each one of the 10 trillion cells
- omniscient, omnipotent, and infallible: all-knowing, all-powerful, and incapable of error
- just waiting for a chance to fix what is broken

Hygienic darkroom retreating is that chance.

#### secret

At last we are prepared to understand the secret of why hygienic darkroom retreating works. There are three reasons.

1. Physiology
    1. Circadian rhythms: The circadian system governs our 24-hour waking-sleep cycle. This system is controlled by the  
[suprachiasmatic nucleus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suprachiasmatic-nucleus). This tiny organ rests atop the chiasm, the intersection of the optic nerves coming directly from the eyes. The nucleus detects the presence or absence light instantly, before the imagery it carries reaches the visual cortex of the brain. 

        To the degree it is dark, the suprachiasmatic nucleus gives, for example, its famous instruction to the pineal gland to secrete [melatonin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melatonin) into the bloodstream. This hormone causes us to sleep, dream, and lose appetite. In absolute extended darkness, the pineal gland _floods_ the body with melatonin, intensifying these restful processes. 

        Melatonin is but one of many hormones, nervous signals, and processes that facilitate the deep rest and sleep necessary to recover from and assimilate the benefits of waking life.
    2. Destimulation 
        - Sensory processing: we conserve the significant effort and energy of sensory processing. Sight requires twice as much processing as all other senses combined. Darkness eliminates vision and minimizes other sensation. 
        - Calm: without the abstract food of visual data, the abstract mind slows down
            - fewer thoughts occur
            - thinking becomes harder
            - thinking becomes _less interesting_ (!)
            - directing attention restfully becomes *much* easier. (See [*protocol > attention*](/protocol#attention))

            The concrete sensations that remain tend to feed the feeling center of intelligence. Externally undistracted, the internal sense of touch sharpens in its [many aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense). Intuition and instinct, suppressed aspects of consciousness in civilization are thus reactivated. They balance the psychic workload, making it more efficient, saving energy and internal activity.
2. Environment: a retreat provides not only darkness, but all conditions of profound rest:
    - safety, comfort, silence, solitude, and _time_
    - fresh air, warmth, and natural food

        The contemporary scientific approach to darkroom retreating is called _chamber REST_ (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique). As the name implies, and in accord with scientific materialism, it tends to reduce a retreat and its effects to destimulation: absence of usual sensory impositions. But the organism does not experience darkness, for example, as the absence of light, as a negative; but rather, as a positive fact, the presence of something which the active organism take hold of and uses.
3. Attitude: knowledge of hygiene's passive attitude toward healing helps align the conscious and unconscious parts of the self. This is the meaning of poise in hygiene. It enables the internal peace and cooperation necessary for full healing and function to occur.

In terms of experiencing profound rest and the miraculous healing that inevitably results, a hygienic darkroom retreat is the perfect storm.
