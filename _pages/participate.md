Join the dolphin economy: I help you help me help you...

You can help by: 

- telling me about spelling and grammatical errors you find in the book
- sending me a question or comment
- darkening your room
- retreating according to this method at home or at a center
- buying this book after reading it if you find it useful and didn't buy it before
- reporting your experience online with photos and sending me the link
- improving the method and designs
- improving the website
- publishing the book. See [license](/about/license)
- invite me to speak at an event
- helping me organize a retreat so I can heal from my own psychosis
- doing something not listed above, perhaps what only you know about or that we could develop together

If you find a theoretical or practical error in the approach or a way to improve it, please let me know. I am happy to alter the book if your proposal:

- presents a rational argument
- remains consonant with hygienic principles
- includes clear reports of your own reproducible experiments with the current method

Likewise, I am open to working with you in any way to develop hygienic darkroom retreating and advance its cause as long as you:

- have read my book 
- demonstrate understanding of its basic ideas
- have done a retreat according to my protocol and are convinced of the value of my approach
