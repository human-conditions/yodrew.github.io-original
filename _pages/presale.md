title: Darkness Presale

I believe joy is natural. Through investigation, I discovered darkness is the essential condition nature gives us to reverse the cause of our suffering and restore joy. Using hygiene, the science of health, I developed a model for using darkness to produce reliable miracles.

The hygienic use of darkness results in:

- relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness
- natural healing from major trauma, the cause of human suffering and problems
- recovery of the lost self
- restoration of personal power

My readers and I have glimpsed these benefits in our preliminary retreats. To realize them fully requires a self-supporting, organized team. 

#### startup

Thus, I am starting a business. To fund it, I am pre-selling everything I plan to offer:

- information: my book in paperback, lectures, training
- services: consultations, retreats, gift certificates
- goods: darkroom components, darkrooms, neighborhoods, microfactories

Below, the presale's unusual TERMS reward past supporters. The MENU lists goods and services, their shipping dates, and prices. The GOAL of the campaign is $9,700. The minimum is $1,700. The PLAN shows what I'll do to startup.

#### terms

- prices $USD, shipping added at checkout 
- $regular price, $*price with credit.
- you have credit if you ever gave me money before:
    - donations
    - contributions to my 2016 crowdfund
    - leanpub purchases (credited 70%)
    - mention your prior contribution with a record (eg, a leanpub order #). If you lost it, I might have it. I gladly honor claims from anyone who helped me in any way since my research and development began 32 years ago.
    - credit is tranferable

#### goal

- goals staged from $1700 minimum to $9700
- items
- costs cover credit redemptions, manufacturing, and shipping

| Goal  | Item                                    | Amount | Total |
| -----:| --------------------------------------- | ------:| -----:|
|  1    | computer for writing                    |   1700 |  1700 |
|  2    | legal counsel for forming business      |   1700 |  3400 |

|  6    | debt 2                                  |   1500 |  9700 |

#### plan

1. promote presale and reach first goal
2. order computer
3. update and expand promotion of crowdfund
4. edit book with some work on business and components
    - edit book
        - integrate final pieces of model
        - refine organization of book content
        - simplify sentence style and structure for clarity, easier reading and translation (grueling work)
        - get book copyedited, proofread, and designed
        - assembly drawings may come in the next edition or as a separate book
        - print and ship on schedule
    - develop business
        - study the startup process 
        - create pitch deck and other business documents to organize work, attract funding and team
    - components: 
        - develop production processes and tooling
        - refine recent prototypes
5. after book ships
    - produce and ship components on schedule
    - lecture: 
         - refine existing talk according to completed model
         - make offers to speak in public
    - begin prototyping darkroom
    - seminar: plan and organize
            
#### risks

I could print the current version of the book right now and ship it. I have done so many times. It is 98% of what I want it to be when I do ship it in four months. 

I have made everything else in the list except where noted. I have shipped things internationally from both America and Europe. 

I grew up around small businesses of my parents and their friends, worked closely with entrepreneurs and read business books my whole life, and have done business consulting. I know double entry accounting, spreadsheets, basic law, history, and philosophy.

The biggest risk is if the world ends. I don't think it will. Things are getting hairy. I'll find a way to fill your order.

The worst case scenario is if hygienic darkroom retreating doesn't happen because people don't try. It is my function in life, so I am going to keep at it.

#### conclusion

Thanks for your consideration and support.
