<h4 id="intro">intro</h4>
<p>I believe joy is natural. I searched nature for its cause. Nature showed me the way it gives us to reverse the cause of our suffering and problems.</p><p>I slowly developed a model of it. It is called hygienic darkroom retreating. It is subtle, its effects rapid. It reliably leads to miracles. </p><p>These include:</p><ul><li>relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness</li><li>natural healing from trauma, the cause of suffering</li><li>restoration of the personal power necessary for freedom</li><li>return of the lost self</li></ul><p>My readers and I tasted these benefits in trial retreats. Now that the model is complete, everyone could benefit fully. It just needs a self-supporting, organized team. Thus...</p><h4 id="startup">startup</h4>
<p>I am starting a business. We will do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating:</p><ul><li>writing, speaking, teaching, interviews, and media production</li><li>consultation, retreat support</li><li>research and development</li><li>manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and installation</li><li>sales of related products from other companies, including humane technology</li></ul><p>The business has unlimited potential. The model has implications for every field. It will scale at a regular pace but its influence will scale very fast. It can transform not merely an industry. It can redefine the world&#39;s economy and our entire way of life. </p><p>To begin funding it, I am: </p><ul><li>preselling our catalog:<ul><li>information: my book in paper, lectures</li><li>services: consultation, retreats</li><li>goods: componentry, darkrooms, microfactories, neighborhoods</li></ul></li><li>fundraising with asset-backed credits</li><li>using the startup process to form the business and attract capital</li></ul><p>The vision of Human Conditions is the restoration of the original human condition of joy, health, and freedom. Our mission is to make darkness approachable by ordinary people on normal terms. This means making it a turnkey, franchise operation. <em>Click</em>, and it just works. I mean perfectly, beautifully, in every way, for everyone involved.</p><p>Human Conditions will be the first darkroom operation to meet this world-class standard. People have no time for anything less. There is no reason they should. </p><p>This remains true even now. The world is in dire need of a sane vision of life and a way to bring it about. Yet the soul maintains its composure at all costs. It has endured all awaiting nature&#39;s true solution. The first plausible candidate has come.</p><p>~~</p><p>The presale&#39;s unusual <strong>terms</strong> reward past supporters. The <strong>catalog</strong> lists offerings with delivery dates, prices, and drop-down descriptions. It is also the order form, with fields for quantities and options . The <strong>goal</strong> of the presale is $11,400. The <strong>plan</strong> tells how we will proceed.</p><h4 id="terms">terms</h4>

<p>The amount of the goal will cover new equipment, legal counsel, services, and costs (materials, tooling, services). The purchase schedule is staged. Once sales reach $3000, the presale will have momentum and I will have enough to pay for a new computer. Then I can begin the startup process and edit my book while managing the presale.</p><p>I will make up any shortfall through the startup process (see plan). This would not delay book production. It might delay assembly drawings and book redesign till next edition.</p><p>A third of the income from each stage will pay for items listed. Two-thirds will pay business costs: manufacturing, expenses, and debts. Shipping is not included.</p><table>

<h4 id="qualifications-and-risks">qualifications and risks</h4>
<p>I could print the current edition of the book right now and ship it. Over the years, I have done so many times. Basically, it is good. Readers find it substantive, clear, and well-written. It contains a thousand times more information than I had when I first retreated. Its theme, the restful use of darkness, remains constant.</p><p>The book has 98% of the content I want it to have when it ships in five months. From tests, I know how long my intended method of revision takes. Making theoretical breakthroughs as I work and managing the pre-sale will take more time. It is all built into the schedule to ensure timely delivery.</p><p>I have produced or prototyped everything in the list except where noted. I have experience shipping things internationally from both America and Europe. 
I grew up around small business. My father, his business partners, extended family, and friends always whisked me behind the scenes to see how things worked. I have worked closely with entrepreneurs in both publishing and manufacturing, read business books my whole life, and have done business consulting. I know double-entry accounting, spreadsheets, simple programming, basic law, history, philosophy. I have recovered enough personal power to succeed in a rough and tumble world. </p><p>Through rehydration, a hygienic practice, I have recently found a simple way to reverse the worst of my crippling health issues. Day by day, I am restored to function. This is another example, in 32 years of relentless, uncompromising effort, of my resourcefulness and diligence in finding ways to continue. After nine months of gestating my completed model, I am clear about what I am doing and how to proceed.</p><p>Socially, a stable web of relationships with my neighbors and international collaborators holds me. Politically and economically, I am still vulnerable. This presale is designed to amend that. The legal help I will retain will help me deal with the strange political changes occurring globally.</p><p>Inaction is the biggest risk we face. If no one tries to realize this idea, if its influence never bears on world conditions, we will lack the most powerful possible means of dealing with the nonsense that confronts us today. The Adversary has lately increased his destabilizing pressure. I have studied his ways for the last three years and minimized my exposure. I&#39;m a survivor with a unique set of skills. I&#39;ll find a way to fill your order and execute my plan.</p><h4 id="conclusion">conclusion</h4>
<p>&quot;Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world,&quot; said Archimedes. A corollary is to find the small lever at the world&#39;s center that activates all its processes. </p><p>Nature has revealed that lever to me as the hygienic use of darkness. It widens the baffling bottleneck we are stuck in. It enables the human soul to rapidly restore itself and then the world. It is the most crucial thing I could find to do. The task has stretched me to the breaking point several times. Somehow, it keeps easing me back. So far, so good.</p><p>Thank you for your ongoing interest, consideration, and support. Today, we begin again.</p>
