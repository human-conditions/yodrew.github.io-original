#### startup

I am starting a business. To fund it, I am pre-selling everything I plan to offer:

- information: my book in paperback, lectures, training
- services: consultations, retreats, gift certificates
- goods: darkroom components, darkrooms, neighborhoods, microfactories

Below, the presale's unusual TERMS reward past supporters. The MENU lists goods and services, their shipping dates, and prices. The GOAL of the campaign is $9,700. The minimum is $2,000. The PLAN shows what I'll do to startup.

#### terms

- prices $USD, shipping added at checkout 
- $regular price, $*price with credit.
- you have credit if you ever gave me money before:
    - donations
    - contributions to my 2016 crowdfund
    - leanpub purchases (credited 70%)
    - mention your prior contribution with a record (eg, a leanpub order #). If you lost it, I might have it. I gladly honor claims from anyone who helped me in any way since my research and development began 32 years ago.
    - credit is transferable

#### risks and qualifications

I could print the current version of the book right now and ship it. I have done so many times. It has 98% of the content I want it to have when it ships in four months. I have tested the revisions I plans

I have produced or at least prototyped everything else in the list except where noted. I have shipped things internationally from both America and Europe. 

I grew up around the small businesses of my father, extended family, friends, and townspeople. I worked closely with entrepreneurs, read business books my whole life, and have done business consulting. I know double-entry accounting, spreadsheets, simple programming, basic law, the military attitude, history, and philosophy.

The biggest risk is if the world ends. I don't think it will. Things are getting hairy. I'm a survivor. I'll find a way to fill your order using my unique set of skills.

The worst case scenario is if hygienic darkroom retreating doesn't happen because people don't try. It is my function in life, so I am going to keep at it.

#### conclusion

Thanks for your consideration and support.
