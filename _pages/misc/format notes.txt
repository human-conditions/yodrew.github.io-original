_Note: Read this section as the 8-day retreat section builds on it. If a  good darkroom is available, I no longer recommend 4-day retreats for most people. It is much better to begin with an 8-day retreat. If you really need rest, a 4-day retreat will just get your head above water without beginning to address what put you under in the first place. If you are truly well-rested, a 4-day retreat will be too short for you to have a strong experience of yourself in darkness._ 

_Do it only if an 8-day retreat feels too long for you or your circumstances disallow it in the next couple months. Trust your feeling about this. Life and healing move slowly. Now that you have found a realistic way to heal from all the pain and illness in your life, so can you._
