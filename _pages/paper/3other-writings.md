#### rethinking Objectivism's first axiom

_for my friend, Sterling,
and for Michael Stuart Kelly and the generous crew at [www.objectivistliving.com][1]_

> "Do you want to assess the rationality of a person, a theory or a philosophical system? Do not inquire about his or its stand on the validity of reason. Look for the stand on axiomatic concepts. It will tell the whole story."
&ndash;Ayn Rand, _Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology _

Words have always meant a great deal to me. And so when I, as a student of the work of Ayn Rand, took _existence_ into the deepest reaches of my mind as the sole content of _reality_, two things happened. First, it quickly began to restore the natural but damaged connection between myself and the obvious facts around me. But, second, in a strange and menacing way, it began to short-circuit my person until I could barely move or breathe.

Nothing can be considered at the expense of everything. I had taken existence to be everything. But as I would soon discover, it simply is not.

There is what exists. And there is what is. Existence and being. Just about everyone, including Ayn Rand, has used the words, existence and being, interchangeably. And yet Ayn Rand herself taught that only in slang do different words mean exactly the same thing. In formal language, different words always mean different things, however slight or confounded by centuries of inattention be the difference. The words, existence and being, belong to formal language. Therefore they mean different things.

On some level, _everyone knows this_. Else why have two words? Further, I assert that the ancient meanings ascribed to these words, because they still provide a vital distinction, live on subconsciously in us. And until we bother to make the distinction conscious again and live accordingly, they will cause us confusion, strife—and schism.

So let us look at these words closely. _Being_ is pretty easy, being an inflection, in this case, a gerund form, of the verb, _to be_. Being refers to what is. This is airtight, a tautology. But what of this multi-syllabic, Latin-rooted word, _existence_? Reading these words' definitions, even in the Oxford English Dictionary, one can tell little if any difference between them.

Lexicographers generally do not define axiomatic concepts ostensively with tautologies. I hope that Ayn Rand's approach will reach them faster than Aristotle's reached Aquinas. In the meantime, where usage or definitions have, over time, collapsed together the meanings of different words, I find etymologies highly useful for pulling them back apart. This is because etymologies often provide the only distinguishing characteristic in the entire entry of a word. In the etymology of existence, the difference between it and being literally stands out. Existence comes from the Latin, _existere_, which means, _to stand out_.

To exist is to stand out. Existence is that which stands out.

In contrast, there is nothing in being that says anything about standing out—or up, or in, or anything else. It just is. So existence is not the same as being after all. Further, it is not _ as much_ as being. Existence is merely what stands out.

Reality, which had, for me, shrunk to the size of a room, then a postage stamp, then a pinhead, then to a vacuum, suddenly expanded. I could breathe again.

I wonder how much of the work of intellectuals consists of reclaiming words and reasserting their essential meanings. Anyway, a few implications of the Latin enable further elaboration of the point. First, having discovered that existence is what stands out, the question arises: Stands out… from what?

Well, from whatever stands back, apparently. A thing cannot stand out from nothing. It can only stand out from something else. So even without knowing what is back there, we know _ that_ something is back there. It does not exist, yet it is.

Again we find that existence is not the same as being. Existence is not all that is, so it cannot make up all of reality. Existence fails as a word meant to refer to everything and therefore, as an axiomatic concept.

To continue to use the word, existence, to refer to everything—besides violating logic itself as well as a principle of formal language—is to engage, quite contrary to Ayn Rand's claims and intentions, in the non-scientific discussion of cosmology. After all, if we are going to start talking about the precise physical nature of reality beyond the facts that: it is; it is what it is; and one is conscious of it; then we, as philosophers, have crossed over the proper bounds of philosophy and fallen into this ancient mystical trap. Ergo, both the relapsed mysticism and the resorting to physics in philosophical dialogue among Objectivists (and the public at large, for that matter), as if philosophy cannot find its way without the latest findings of quantum physicists.

Second, in the belief in reality as consisting only of existence, what happens to whatever it is that stands back?

That's easy: it gets ignored. It is and therefore, is real, but it is off limits. Of course, no philosophy can keep a part of reality off limits forever, because it keeps crashing into people's lives. As the Bard had warned my father, who, in turn, warned me: "There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

Third, and perhaps more apropos in the context of a discussion of objectivity—which this, as a discussion among Objectivists, implicitly is—we could ask the question: Stands out… to whom? For surely everything that stands out to me is not exactly the same as everything that stands out to you. Reality is what it is, not a matter of consensus based on the lowest common denominator of sensitivity.

Personally, it kills me: the irony of basing Objectivism on just the sort of usually delightful variety which, when used for this serious a purpose, can only result in the arch-doctrinaire subjectivism that riddles this school. But this, unfortunately, has become a big part its internal mythology.

For all these reasons and more, I propose a correction to Objectivism at its root, generated by its own methods to meet its own standards. Let us replace the word, existence, with the word, being: as the primary axiomatic concept of Objectivism; wherever the philosophy refers to what is; and wherever the philosophy refers to the content of reality.

Two corollary changes follow from this replacement that must be mentioned here, if not developed fully. One, Objectivism's first axiom becomes _being is_. Two, this axiom enables a formal definition of reality which establishes in one stroke the objectivity of reality, the primacy of being, and the indissoluable relationship between being and consciousness: reality is _being as object_. Being is the object of its subject, consciousness.

In addition to being, we have in the Anglo-Saxon two unequivocal words to use in normal discourse about it: _everything_ and its absence, _nothing_. (I see no reason to conceive of "non-being", and no way to do so without "reifying the zero".) Then we have plenty of phrases for being (eg, _what is_) and ways to describe it—as many as there are poets, probably. What happens to existence and its silent partner, _non-existence_? I think scientists, both material and spiritual alike, would appreciate this distinction. It could serve criticism, of course, as it has here. But I think it is not for Philosophy, which precedes these issues.

Some may say, "What's the big deal? It is just how we use language." I would reply, Yes, and look at the schizophrenic culture we live in as a result. Moreover, look at what rigorously equating existence and being has done to Objectivism and Objectivists: chronically split it again and again. As John Galt told Dagny, "…you're free to change your course. But as long as you follow it, you're not free to escape its logic." Look, as well, at the harmony a change such as I propose would restore to thought and culture alike. A great relaxation in communication becomes possible when people cease to exclude from their idea of reality some things in favor of others, probably without even knowing they have been doing so.

We have this sacred word, being, that serves the purpose of denoting that which is with tautological perfection. This idea, existence, is unneeded by the essentially unifying philosophy of Objectivism, and certainly not at its deepest root, fracturing our consciousness of reality and our connection to each other.

It is. I am. At the base of philosophy, at the beginning of metaphysics, I need know nothing else.

####  the operative principle of band society

As the ragged beast of civilization groans its last (again), many of its refugees have begun to enjoy success in our search for an alternative approach to social organization. Beyond civilization–and way beyond its pitiful flagship, intentional community–lie far more enduring, fun, and reasonable forms of society worth considering. Lately, tribalism is all the rage, and deservedly so. It has made a fruitful change in how millions of us explore ideas, art, and livelihood.

Yet the primary form of human social organization may actually be what is known as _band society_. A band is basically an extended family functioning as a complete society. In the continuum of social organization, bands stand opposite of civilization, with its fanatical moralism, hierarchy, and conquests, on the far side of its earlier forms, chiefdoms and tribes.

In this essay, I will name the operative principle of band society. This identification makes it instantly possible for anyone to consciously participate in band relationship. "Band" being simply another way of looking at family, this principle also aids immensely in the restoration of damaged familial relationships.

Besides family, I would like to point out that the feeling of band relationship is also fully embodied in the ecstatic, subversive groove of popular music, which itself is a product of bands. The primal force of band relationship may very well have fueled the worldwide rock-n-roll revolution. In turn, rock-n-roll has re-seeded band society where it wanes most: under the disintegrating influence of industrialization.

Throughout the essay, I also contrast band society with civilization. An eerie consistency in civilization's suppression of life emerges, as well as clues to an unexpectedly simple process of re-expression in bands.

Lastly, when I say civilization, I do not mean just industrial (patriarchal) or agricultural (matriarchal) civilization; or modern or ancient civilization; or Eastern or Western civilization. I just mean civilization: this thing we're supposed to be proud of being members of, whether we push papers, bow to Mecca, or sow rice. In my view, when Gandhi was asked what he thought of Western Civilization and he replied, "It would be a good idea," he was terribly mistaken. Western Civilization is exactly what India had gotten (after being pummeled for the umteenth time by Eastern Civilization). As far as I'm concerned, it is all the same, and below, I make it as clear as I can why I think so.

~/~

**S**omething happens in a band that makes it a band rather than just an amicable form of civilization. Band and civil society differ in their treatment of a fundamental attribute of humanity: our _sociality_. Bands attend it. Civilizations deny it. Everything else about them arises from this single fact.

This distinction between band and civil social organizations succinctly shows why and how each of them operate, in every detail. In this essay, I tell about the natural propensity for attending sociality—for remaining aware of human connectedness. I show why band people deny it not, and how this non-action leads to their having a lot more fun than civilized people. I also use this idea to expose what and where civilization is, and exactly how one participates, knowingly or not, in its ubiquitous, blasé aggression. Learning this distinction can quicken our decivilization and further motivate us to walk away from its cultural prison–less geographically than in our beings and our lives.

sociality is the inherent, tangible connectedness of people. It is universally felt among members of a family, even if only as an absence, as pain, as numbness. It is a force that holds us together, like gravity. It is often known by touch: an inward, tactile sensation of pressure, often in the gut. It can feel like a magnetic field or infrared heat, a deep vibration or a tailwind. It connects us across time and space and across all cultural and language barriers.

Many other words indicate sociality, including: affinity, attachment, bond, sisterhood, empathy. Band members are aware all the time that _something is here_ within us, between us, _as us_. An energy, a presence, a force. It conditions all relating in a band; it is the frame of reference, the ordinary perspective, of the band mind. sociality is the political corollary of a metaphysical principle: the connectedness of all things. As part of attending reality, attending sociality is precisely how to be in a band on a moment-to-moment basis.

Restoring attention to sociality can require different efforts, including: considering the idea of sociality; noticing one's denial of it; remembering it; restoring receptivity to it; restoring awareness of it; observing ourselves, each other, and the world through it. I believe these are some steps that we will take on our journey home: over the wall of and beyond civilization (and beyond tribalism), to a new form of the band ways of our ancestors.

Actually, this key to band society has stared me in the face from within my own definition (of a tribe) since 2001. But still thinking on civilization's terms, I have been blind to its importance till now.

A band is a group of people relating to each other

  * on the basis of inherent human sociality
  * according to like-activities
  * for the purpose of making a living together.*

This combines four ideas of alternative social organization: Jean Liedloff's idea of sociality (that we have it)1 ; my adaptation of the essence of the definition of intentional community (from shared values to like-activities2 ); Daniel Quinn's definition of a tribe ("a group of people making a living together" 3 ); and John Zerzan's insight that in this essay, I am describing not tribal but _band_ society (see Afterword).

For awhile, I focused on like-activity in my thinking, writing, and relationships. But like-activity, I have learned, merely influences a band's _membership_: which particular people are in a band together. Like-activity differs from like-mindedness, civilization's sorting criterion. But what makes the elegant functioning of a band possible, and what makes a band radically different from civilized groups, including intentional communities (!), lies in the part about the basis of its members' _relationship:_ their inherent sociality.

Everyone has felt attached to other people. It makes us naturally drawn to and able to relate to each other. It is why the anti-social and awkward among us seem to us somehow ill: divided against themselves because they are divided against us. Their concern, though negative, is still with us. There is no way to beat it. We do not come together. We are already together. Something here connects us (which, again is of the same substance as us). Because it is built in, we do not have to make up or maintain our social nature .

In fact, just the opposite: we canot help it. Consider, for example, the Stockholm Syndrome: even the prisoners in concentration camps find a way to relate to the guards. Or how appealing to you is the life of a hermit or voluntary castaway? Our bond is real, tangible, and available, especially when we are free of the struggle caused by denying it. Whether we know it or not, it is always at work organizing, guiding, unifying, and harmonizing us. It does this despite the vast machinery of the state, with which we keep ourselves in —how shall I put it?— our peculiar handbaskets. It functions as an independent, common, objective point of reference for everyone, with no possibility of mediation or external control.

While everyone feels compelled to keep others' company, only we civilized people have felt wary of it. Mistrustful, dubious, ashamed, anxious, guilty, guarded. From the band perspective, it is such cynicism, antagonism, and isolation that need explaining. I will begin with my definition of civilization:

Civilization is a group of people relating to each other

  * in denial of human sociality
  * according to shared ideals
  * for the purpose of ending suffering

The civilized view of the world is that, while we need a basis for our relationship, we haven't one, so it must be created. Our lacking something we need means we are inadequate. We must make up the difference, in ourselves and in the universe that so deprived us. The effort always seems characterized by over-seriousness, worry, and racing minds. Its products are codes, rules, commandments, and laws; visions, plans, agreements, and more plans.

These in turn require experts to codify and practice them and authorities to enforce them. As they say, "There's gotta be _some_ rules". The rules, based on a falsehood, never fit and so must be constantly qualified or changed. The rules give rise to systems that constantly break down. People compensate with anxiety and blood, and by abusing the world. Once in awhile the masters pay, but mostly it is the peasants. The whole process is characterized by imminent chaos and frantic demagoguery, alternately punctuated by extreme exaltation and extreme horror.

I will state this in a different way, which also explains why it happens. The denial of sociality arises from the universal feeling among the civilized of chronic apprehension4. We have been pleased to call it, "The Human Condition". Yet we have always felt compelled to try to explain or resolve this agony.

Both Western and Eastern civilized philosophy explain it with some form of the doctrine of original sin. The only way we could feel so bad is because we _are_ bad. Original sin is always connected to the assertion of anti-sociality and what values must be sought to counterbalance it.

Indeed, people usually think of their philosophies in terms of values. Values serve two purposes in this context. They define an ideal, which promises to resolve the agony. And they form the tense agreement people make with each other so they can put down their weapons for a little while. The agreement is designed to encourage the achievement of the ideal. Failing that, to keep people from each others throats. Failing that, to determine how to run the various forms of prison in the society (in chronological order: hospitals, TV rooms, playgrounds, churches, schools, clubs, jobs, prisons, houses, recreational vehicles, nursing homes, heaven/hell).

So there you have civilization's metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and politics in a nutshell: self-destructiveness, confusion, alienation, and coercion, respectively. To live as a band member is to live in harmony with people and the world as they are, free of the mortal conflict perpetuated in the bodies of people in civilization by its nihilistic falsehoods, emotional pathology, and bizarre practices. This permanent internal strife has always caused social disintegration, terror, and poverty. Now its effects have reached a fever pitch as a complex, global, ecological crisis that threatens nearly all life on Earth. Some of us, at least, will have to understand exactly what occurs in bands if we are to cross over from our civilized way of life to a band way. But our culture has been demonizing and eradicating band society for millennia. We, the civilized, all too easily project our metaphysics onto band society. This metaphysics must be identified and replaced, that we may separate ourselves from it peaceably and leave it behind as the grand—and potentially transformative—tragedy that it is.

Earlier, I wrote that I have thought on civilization's terms all along. What I meant is that I believed the intentional community movement's definition of itself is correctly formulated. I believed in its _syntax. _So I modified their "shared values", first to "like interests" (desires for similar things). Then to "like activity". (doing similar things.) But again, this is merely how people get sorted into specific groups, not the essential thing that happens in those groups. The real basis of community, as in all civilized configurations, is still sociality, but sociality denied, suppressed, distorted, turned upon itself.

In the West, we tend to experience our denied sociality as mutual judgment and guilt. These days, this goes mostly unadmitted (except in religion and law), but it is implicit in civilization's structure. It is made up of a bunch of rules that will save you, will reform your sinful nature, if you practice them long enough. Achieve the ideal and you become fit for society and life itself. Or at least, a prison cell.

The band view is that the social structure we need is already here, so just pay attention. Observe. Notice. Listen. Feel. Follow. This means that we need not, as a fundamental approach to living, ideate, imagine, design, and create our social structure, as civilization has us doing all the friggin' time. It means remaining attuned to, in communication about, and responsive to a dynamic situation rather than trying to agree all the time on the damn rules. (In this way, civilization can be seen as a huge cult.)

Attending sociality is thus the operative principle of band society and all normal human relationship. This is what band people consciously do continuously, alone or together. Of course, this kind of attention also happens in civilized people. Without it, we'd all be dead. But generally it happens in an unconscious, muted, and distorted way. Mostly, the civilized are busy suppressing the states that naturally arise from this awareness. The salient exceptions are celebrities and stars. They function as our culture's demigods, somehow knowing how to harness these states in spite of massive attention and pressure. And they become incredibly attractive thereby.

When I, as a band member, look at the universe, I see _something_. It is real. It matters. Indeed, if my congenital relationship to it is undisturbed, I am rapt and awed. I find it intoxicatingly beautiful, powerful, and benevolent. Obviously, it is alive, the whole thing and every part of it, including me. It moves. It calls me to move with it, to play my part and give what I have to its process, to what is needed and wanted. By providing this eternal opportunity to contribute, the whole supports me, and I support it in turn.

If my congenital relationship to universe is disturbed, my emotional state is characterized not by rapture but longing. The something is still there, but I am habitually blinded to it, cut off somehow, aware of it only negatively, as an absence. This breach is often long, painful and difficult to heal (though I'm beginning to think not necessarily so).

Yet the process of reunion is a breeze compared to the alternative of lifelong dissatisfaction. And sure enough, the necessary condition for healing is an aspect of the very band habit of mind I'm talking about, the one thing left to us in the situation, and the basic thing we would be doing anyway were we completely healthy: observation, especially self-observation. I mean this in the Gurdjieffian sense of using one's severely weakened will to: discover oneself as a machine, observe one's pervasive automatism, and record the data for later (mostly subconscious) integration into self-understanding. Generally, this brings both great relief and great sorrow, and wipes out delusions of control of oneself. Eventually, self-understanding comes, restoring strength to will and enabling us to participate in life, to play our part in the world fully, not as mere machines, but as human beings.5

This leads to the third part of the definition of a band: making a living together. Paying attention to sociality occurs within the context of making a living. We're not just listening for anything. We have got lives to support. We need indications relevant to that purpose. A whole moment's worth of stuff has to get done _now_. Life is a call to live, to function, to work. Whether that means collecting berries, making money, holding someone quietly as she cries, or watching a ballet, all of life stretches to meet itself through us.

This force between us—call it love, intimacy, sociality, lifeforce, God, the sacred, the Ordering Principle—wants to serve us and for us to serve it in turn. This force animates what I have heard called the dolphin economy: I help you help me help you help me help you… It is funny that everyone feels this without necessarily knowing how crucial it is to our moment-to-moment survival and well-being. Civilization marginalizes it, co-opts it, and blinds us to it with religion, morality, and its grandiose technological projects. Nonetheless, we belong to it. We are it. It is our simple if awkward task to know it again, and to have it weave us back into itself as we continue learning how to follow it.

I feel it now as I listen to my favorite band's new record. Soon, I will see them for the first time. Another fan once told me that at their concerts, the thing is, everyone is happy. The way he said it made it sound to me like people there feel this force among themselves strongly. But they also likely believe that it is just to be reserved for special occasions, not to be sullied with considerations of livelihood and politics. No, for that we have corporations and cops. Besides, what else is there? The concert was wonderful. Now back to the grind.

As a civilized person, I look at the universe and see nothing. At best, a canvas, a field for my imagination and conquest. What I need is not here. So I must make it. It is my job to generate content and impose it everywhere so that I might one day have the proper surrounding. The city, a completely built environment, is the logical consequence of this gnawing sense of life. I lead the way. I am in control. If anything gets in the way (and so much does seem to get in the way), then I must strike it down and trample it underfoot. I am making the world a better place. In dealing with others, I must put myself out there, break the ice, build bridges, create relationship, build community, get to know people, stay in touch, provide leadership, share my vision, etc.

Or build walls against people. Because there is nothing between us, certainly nothing good. No bond. No web holding us together. And anything I make will quickly erode, so I must maintain eternal vigilance. In fact, I must build and continually expand my empire to defeat the ever-advancing disintegrative forces of the universe, which people actually epitomize. And on and on.

Incidentally, some radical legal research shows that a citizen (from the Latin, _civis,_ which is also the root of city, civil, and civilization) has the _legal status_ of a slave. Combine that with the saying going round lately that, "only slaves love power", and you have a pretty clear idea of the self-hating, escapist motivations of the civilized, whether conscious or not.6

In contrast, in a band, we know that no one built our relationship, and that nothing can destroy it, either. We rest in it, serve it — and stay out of its way. Certain of us have found ourselves together by chance or because of the particular things we do. But the condition of our being together is not what we do, but what we are: social beings. Our social nature makes it necessary and possible for us to be together and thus to do certain things together.

If there were nothing between us, we would have to make something up to base our relationship on. This making-up would become our primary activity. And, in fact, in our culture today, it is. It's called law. However, since there _is_ something, we can move within it together now. This, too, happens among us. This is where the operative principle of bands kicks in: in moving together, with our attention on the subtle energetic field we share, as well as the more gross facts of reality, our movements are guided and coordinated for the benefit of us and all our relations. And not by some propped up legal or divine authority, but by reality itself.

We can observe life in its connective aspect as a force—exactly what Obi Wan Kenobi told us about. Being alive, this force has a purpose: to live. It constantly indicates a direction to follow that serves both it and its followers, both as a group and individually. In a band, our basic _attitude_ is one of receptivity. All our cues for how to act come from what is and from what is happening. There is no vacuum for us to fill with content, but rather a_plenum_ to be aware of. The basic verbal condition among us is silence. When one person notices something relevant that the others have not, she lets the others know, amplifying the signals Universe continually gives us. Which is probably why stories of indigenous councils often mention the silences that prevail among the elders there. Pregnant silences. Vast silences lasting for hours and days. Or so I have heard.

This is an elementary realization. It is philosophic, basic, within anyone's reach. It is just a different way of seeing things, a different habit. It is not hard to see this way, just unfamiliar. In fact, everyone already does see this way to some degree all the time and then intensely in moments. Everyone remembers these moments. It is just that we have just been trained to dismiss them, to ignore them, to discount them, to escape, to misidentify and misunderstand them. The basic friction or difficulty of seeing this way arises from one's denial that there is even anything here to see. (Examples: "It's just a bunch of trees." Parent: "What did you do at school today?" Child: "Nothing." "This will make a great parking lot." "You sure are quiet." "Why won't he look me in the eye?") The denial is habitual, unconscious (though it continually surfaces for conscious affirmation), and reinforced by artificial stimulation.

At first, I felt nauseous as I stared into the fog of my denial. I began to notice how civilization had put blinders on me so I could not see it. This was irritating, but the irritation itself proved to be yet another distraction I'd been preprogrammed to get lost in. I'd been listening to Life my whole life to some degree, but civilization gave the process different names. Like daydreaming, laziness, being a natural, getting with the program, meditation, etc. Some positive, some negative. All meant to interrupt my listening, and to divert my attention from and suppress my awareness of the lifeforce. Or to harness it for civilized purposes.

The real basis of a band—the minute-to-minute, actual process of being in a band—is the living, heartbreaking, mercurial bond between people and the world. I warn you against trying to make what you believe, desire, or do the basis of any relationship. You will merely end up with a cult, a small version of what you were trying to get away from, with tense thought police as members. I tried a few times as both leader and follower. It is always the same.

Likewise, when meetings, planning, ideas, goals, and an urgency to agree (like the weeks preceding a presidential election) dominate meaningful time with others in the group, something is amiss. You can tell you are back in civilization, no matter where you are geographically, when you hear a lot of questions, especially, "what should I do?". The aggressive attitude that often animates such questions is totally at odds with the receptivity, the observant quality, required to know what is really going on in a situation.

Somebody has an ideal. It mutates into an agenda. The agenda, disguised as a question, poisons the atmosphere. How many times have we seen or felt it happen? _Vision_ is another common imposition, in which imagination and fantasy have replaced plain _seeing_. Then come the proposals,_ ad nauseum_, to fill the void God abandoned us in.

What is needed is silence, an awakening to our pretense and denial, and attention to our amazing bond. It lies at the root of both genuine authority and humility. Good heavens, sometimes all I can see is 400 generations of native peoples looking at me with broken hearts and fingers pressed against lips, shh. Okay, grandparents, I am almost finished here.

Life speaks all the time, and we hear it. Then we either deny it or listen to it. The wicked deny it, then wait in vain for it to raise its voice, to butt into their rants and interpersonal tape-playing. The graceful listen to it, hear it clearly and follow it closely, with felicitous success. Everyone has made this simple discovery a hundred times, but our mechanical brains immediately adapt to it, just as civilization has trained them. I remember thinking, when things went well, that I had made them go well, and I could do it again. Pride goeth before a fall. I think that civilization's first axiom, its number one message, is that nothing and no one is here. Therefore there is nothing to attend, to know for oneself or with others. One is left with convention: obeying it, rebelling, making up a new one, or giving up. Those are the only options. God, it is such a great game!

This lifeforce and our hearing it is, I believe, exactly what Ms Liedloff speaks of as the continuum and our sense of it. We are heading back into life, I think, and, as always, with our elders' help. Thanks and much love to Jean and Daniel, John, Georges, and Ayn and countless other voices of life pouring out now. I kiss the seven directions and all my relations, including this crazy computer and even,

W.

Yours,
Andrew

**_*This just in _**(April 5): Though band society is closer to what I have been seeking, somehow the essay does not work since I rewrote it with the word, band. But a slightly different definition of a band just occurred to me:

A band is a group of people relating to each other

  * as a family
  * on the basis of inherent human sociality
  * according to the requirements of the moment
  * for the purpose of living

I believe this will help expose and solve whatever the problem is and lead to a much clearer presentation, either in a revision of this piece or a new one. Stay tuned.

**Afterword **
An idea haunts those of us who acutely experience the misery of modern, industrial civilization:

_"There must be another way."_

For awhile, the way seemed to me to lay in tribal society, especially as presented by Daniel Quinn. I very much appreciate both his mythological analysis of our quandary and his concrete suggestions for restoring tribal society in our current lives. In studying and applying his ideas in prose, relationship, and design, I learned many useful things, and I owe him a great debt.

After working with Mr Quinn's ideas for about five years, my understanding of tribalism came to fruition in this essay. I showed it to John Zerzan, whom I had the good fortune to meet and live near for awhile. He read and liked the essay very much. And he made the astonishing comment that I was not actually describing tribal society, but _band_ society. Further, that a tribe's larger population, division of labor, nascent stratification, and widespread longing for a former state of grace may well represent a people's first step toward civilization. He recommended the anthropology of Elmer Service. I read some of Service's _Primitive Social Organization_, which offered detailed support for Mr Zerzan's comment.

In reading about bands, tribes, and chiefdoms, I got to wondering more deeply about natural human society in general. Band society sounded very good. But if I was wrong about tribal society, maybe band society was not really what I was looking for either. I felt there was still something unnecessarily abstract about it. Was there no simpler way to describe natural human society? Let's say we scrape away all the abstractions and just look at people as they are, in all circumstances. What is left? What do we see?

Well, I see extended family. Despite the family-destroying institutions of civilization, people still attract each other, reproduce, and tend to stay together as extended family (including adopted friends). Whatever ideas we form about people, be they political, sociological, anthropological, or historical; and whatever complex or sinister groups arise among people, I posit that extended family is the essence of human society.

With this insight, I first attempted to rewrite this essay using the word, family, in place of the word, tribe. It did not work. Being from different categories of concepts, family and civilization do not contrast well. A less personal, more abstract idea is actually necessary.

Having found family at the core of band society, I have thus adopted the idea of band society and finally rewritten the essay using the term. _A band is the extended family in the capacity of being an entire society_. Of course, I'm not talking about family as one of civilization's television-and-ice cream-fueled, cannon-fodder production units, ie, the isolated and neurotic nuclear family; but the social structure of the loving, mature, and self-sufficient extended family found in many cultures even today. Of course this is increasingly rare among us anymore, but we can find aspects of it. We can rediscover ourselves, reconnect with elders and relatives, and begin to see our friends in a new light. We can meet indigenous and more traditional peoples who demonstrate more of it.

Close-knit family is our past, our future, and our secret present. When alone, all those I love and miss—or hate and avoid— live on in my mind. They encourage or plague me. Either way, they call me back to my natural life in the close company of others. It will not be all fun and games. Self-knowledge is a fiery mistress. Renewed motivation in one's own atrophied being can be very confusing, even dangerous. But it cannot be any worse than the nonstop domestic cold warfare we already endure.

**Notes**

  1. Jean Liedloff wrote _The Continuum Concept_ and several articles on natural human relationship, especially parent-child relationship. Articles at http://www.continuum-concept.org
  2. Laird Schaub, former editor of _Communities_magazine, once wrote there something like, "Community is a group of people living together on the basis of shared values." (circa 1997) This idea is echoed by others on the Intentional Communities website, especially here: http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/05quest.php
  3. Daniel Quinn wrote the _Ishmael_ trilogy and _Beyond Civilization_, about "another story to be in."
  4. Contrary to a common philosophical conceit, a metaphysics (a view of the nature of woman and world) originates rarely from objective contemplation, but from one's _sense of life_: an inexplicable and apparently irreducible feeling about life itself. The feeling is somehow so close to a thought as to be nearly indistinguishable. When someone says, "That's life," or "Life's not like that," you are hearing her verbalize her sense of life, what Ayn Rand (like Gurdjieff, a great Russian Objectivist) defined as "an implicit metaphysics". An explicit metaphysics rarely does more than verbalize, establish, and _perpetuate_ the sense of life of those who accept it. Ultimately, however, one's actual (not merely professed) ideas derive from experience. Thus no change in one's conscious metaphysics is complete until one feels it throughout the body, in the muscles, movements, and cells. And while immersion in the study of rational philosophy (dharma, the Teaching, the Way, etc) is a condition for a change of mind, special conditions must also be provided the body and heart to support the restoration of health in them. It is Aristotle meets Reich and Shelton meets Rumi.
  5. Much of Georges Ivanovich Gurdjieff's teaching is faithfully reproduced in _In Search of the Miraculous_ by his student, Peter Demianovich Ouspensky. Gurdjieff speaks in depth about attention, especially in the forms of self-observation, self-remembering, and self-unification. In this [cranial supernova][1]of a book, pages 17-22 and 104-115 especially struck me. As you read, feel free to stay with the main, completely understandable narrative, skimming past the sections of esoteric astrophysics and chemistry.
  6. The cause of this reciprocal dynamic is another issue. One interesting hypothesis, completely in line with, for example, Quinn's critique of totalitarian agriculture, population growth and the rise of civilization, lies in [The Origins of Agriculture][2] by Greg Wadley and Angus Martin. The authors propose that our malaise began with the adoption of a grain-based diet, by far the most malnourishing, addictive, and labor intensive diet ever adopted by humans. (It contrasts in every way with the frugivorous diet, masterfully taught by Doug Graham in his recent book, _The 80/10/10 Diet_)

#### understanding Quinn, part 2

A year ago, I wrote an essay called, "Understanding Quinn" to help an acquaintance grasp something about Daniel Quinn's writings. Then, in an online discussion a few months ago, I offered it to Mr Quinn himself as a possible aid to his explaining his own thinking process, which he was pondering out loud. He politely thanked me and said I had not gotten it.*

When my nausea subsided, I perceived the lack of depth in my essay, precisely where I'd wanted to deposit some. I remembered I had not meant the title to refer to the man himself or his process, but to his ideas. Even so, I had missed the mark. So I put the question to myself, "How does he generate these ideas?" When the answer came, I saw that I had dwelt too much on his ethics when such an explanation lies in metaphysics. Like many readers, I'd gotten caught up in doing when he was really talking about_being_.

I think that Mr Quinn consistently surprises with his ideas, not so much because he proposes a surprising purpose, but because he comes from a surprising place. It is not the, _What for?_ that fundamentally distinguishes his message, but the _From where?_ In saying again and again that there is no one right way to live, he has deftly said that living is what we are to do here. This implies that he thinks our world supports life.

This holds a deeper key. Mr Quinn sees that we live in an inhabitable, knowable world. A benevolent universe. In his reports to us from his worldview of it, he waves us in, like a friendly grandfather making us comfortable in our own home. A master metaphysician, he demonstrates that what is—life on earth—is itself what ought to be. To me, he speaks in a voice of the planet itself, seducing us back to our place in it.

In his essay, ["Technology and the Other War,"][1] he illustrates the strange rule he follows in his thinking: "If they give you lined paper, write sideways." In logic, this means checking the premises of a proposition. But you cannot see a proposition's premises if you are so enmeshed in a culture that assumes them that you feel threatened by their exposure. This sort of examination does not threaten Quinn. He declares the imminent doom of the system with all the charm and ease of a neighbor leaning over the back fence, commenting on approaching rain toward the end of a dry spell. He simply sees it from a place other than the one that will, by its own machinations, get washed away in the rain.

A horned, mottled beast of a god, somehow friendly and exciting, not scary, peered through Daniel Quinn's childhood bedroom window. In a dream about the same time, a giant beetle led him into the woods to learn about the world before human domination. In his youth, he saw for an hour the world consumed in a sacred fire. He has felt the heat ever since. Warm and secure, he rests in this ageless view of the world and, thankfully, has the tongue to speak of it, to transmit clue after surprising clue to we who would find our way back to it. Sir, thank you.

_revised 2 Dec 03_

*I got a chance to ask Mr Quinn to read this essay; I am glad to report he likes it.

#### big brother's achilles's heel

**16 Oct 2008**  
Recently, after a year of reading bad news online, I reached the end of my rope. I needed hope. I'd like to share with you how I restored mine.

To rationally find hope, one must first know how things actually stand.* So first, the bad news:

We, the peasantry of the world, are:

  1. cluttering the landscape
  2. uselessly consuming resources
  3. democratically disturbing politics and
  4. generally becoming unnecessary due to technology

Thus, the nobility has decided to eliminate us. And not just the Jews, gays, convicts, dissidents, dark people, etc. But all 6.5 billion of us.

How will they accomplish this? By the following sequence of actions:

  1. withholding energy supplies
  2. escalating genocide through further false-flag terrorism and state responses to it
  3. orchestrating worldwide economic collapse by manipulating money supply
  4. ever-intensifying martial law
  5. disease** and famine
  6. shoah techniques (trains, gassing, concentration camps) surgically but massively applied throughout the First World, and finally—but mainly—
  7. weaponization of the weather

Here is the good news:

With all the world's wealth and power at their disposal, the nobility still require a spiritual source of energy to fuel their hundreds-year-old plan. Due to its nefarious nature, they cannot get spiritual energy directly from divine sources, as other organisms do. So they psychically leech it from other people, en masse, through fear.

To that end, they have lately promulgated three frightening myths:

  1. global terrorism (actually false-flag operations, such as 9/11. I already knew this one.)
  2. peak oil (oil is not fossiline, but geological in origin and superabundant, as demonstrated for decades by the ultra-deep drilling practices of Russian petrogeologists)
  3. CO2-caused global warming (recent climate variation is caused by sunspots, with specific events caused or exacerbated by the HAARP high-frequency transmission array in Alaska.)

Combined with the already embedded meme of over-population, these new myths not only cause a paralyzing degree of fear in people, but pacify us by making an otherwise unfathomable scale of mass depopulation seem inevitable.

This is good news because it means we are not facing unstoppable forces, such as strangely intransigent Muslims, empty oil wells, rising temperatures and ocean levels locked into positive feedback loops. We are facing a tiny cabal of highly disciplined masterminds whose fragile chance of success depends on a stable and near universal state of fear among Earth's people. This is so delicate a condition that even one person who merely begins to see through her fears disrupts the cabal's apple cart.

How is fear seen through? By the only means any culture has found to address any persistent, debilitating emotion at its root and unearth a real foundation for living: spiritual practice, namely, self-observation and self-remembrance (ie, contemplation and meditation, fasting and prayer, etc). Thus, in addition to being the vehicle of spiritual liberation, spiritual practice is the most powerful activity of political liberation one can engage in. \[edit: I now have [a more developed opinion](/) since writing this piece.\]

One may learn this for herself by applying the following propositions as hypotheses:

  1. Though one is helpless to stop fear, it is basically harmless.
  2. Through self-understanding resulting from patient self-observation, the body gradually and automatically releases fear.
  3. As fear is released, it frees vast stores of vital energy for other uses, including physical healing and the simple expression of love.
  4. Fear can be lived with consciously in the meantime, rather than suppressed. (Beware: this also disrupts the energy source of one's own ego. it reacts by mounting increasingly powerful or subtle resistance to efforts at self-awareness. This provides increasingly interesting data to record during self-observation.)
  5. On the other side of emotions—and the rapid thoughts and physical twitches that emotions give rise to—lies the sacred. The sacred can be felt in the gut as butterflies or nausea anytime one places ones attention there, ie, meditates.

Thus, we need not a significant percentage of people to appreciate and live at high levels of activism or sustainability. Individuals and families, one by one, are already awakening to the reality of the sacred, a taste of which dispels all fear. In the face of life's ordinary and extraordinary problems, simple solutions continue to present themselves as they always have. Decreasingly encumbered by fear and the prejudices that accompany it, we become much more able to take up these solutions.

Reality is on our side. In an attack on Life led by a handful of egomaniacs, executed by patsies, and allowed by tenuously ignorant bystanders, which do you suppose will prevail? The egomaniacs need no resistance. They need, and are gradually receiving, love: love in feeling, love in thought, love in action (and, in critical moments, direct action). They are doomed to failure, and we wish not to see our brothers and sisters miss the chance to live as human beings, however benighted and malevolent they may be. Life is wonderful. Thank god for the infinite blessing of life on Earth.

I hope this helps you take heart, as it has helped me. I believe that we live in the middle of a massive upheaval of consciousness, history, and geology; that the river is sweeping us up, one and all; and that there is nothing to fear, even fear itself.

*A friend recently pointed out that even though he disagrees with this description of the current state of affairs, he finds the analysis of fear in the second half of the essay useful.

**I just read a [comically blatant report](http://www.aol.com.au/news/story/Europe-fast-tracking-swine-flu-vaccine/2350992/index.html) about the latest trial balloon, swine flu (which looks like a keeper in the escalating war on the credulous peasantry). Naturally, all the right people, to cover their asses apparently, come out and impotently say that distributing insufficiently tested vaccines should not happen.

\[EDIT: This is a chaotic piece written in the chaotic year preceding the emergence of the conjecture. I was desperately grasping at spiritual straws at the time, even more so than in [sociality-undenied](/other-writings/sociality-undenied), which also addresses self-observation, but from a social perspective. Of course it is hopeless for self-observation to deal with such gigantic problems as I thought it could. This is well-known in the spiritual world self-observation comes from, and I was on the verge of learning it the hard way. Anyway, here you go.\]

#### in brief

Sanity is the basis of health. Sanity is a function of self-knowledge, which results from a certain method of self-obsevation. Without this method, no amount of pursuit of the material conditions of health, such as diet, exercise, etc, will result in actual health. It is possible to get glimpses of health by these means. But the intensity of emotion, memory, repetetive ideation, and physical habits will slam one back to Earth in short order1. To escape this cycle, one must possess a way of catching up with all this internally.

Basically, to begin, one must first entertain receiving a mortal blow to one's self-image. Namely, that while we have the potential of becoming human being—fully rational, choosing creatures—we begin as machines.

Everything I think, everything I feel, everything I do, is an unconscious reaction to external influences, according to the sophisticated design of my particular machine. I do none of it. It all happens with me.

The only sliver of will I possess inside this contraption is the will to see. Not to analyze or figure out why it happened or what else I should try to do. Not to change anything. Not to do—to originate another action. Just to see what is happening with myself as it is.

This requires no faith. Just the willingness to test this perspective as a hypothesis. In this manner, anyone can quickly learn for herself the true extent of her "freedom". It will bring new meaning to the phrase, "I'm just a poor sinner".

Again, when watching, I am not trying to analyze. While my long term goal is self-understanding, my only power for the time being is to see and record what is happening with myself: my movements, my emotions, my thoughts. The light this perspective sheds on my habits begins immediately to expose them to my awareness. Merely by this light, some habits, which can only live in darkness—in ignorance—begin to evaporate.

Others prove more intractable. These can be dissolved, usually, by crying, by exercise, and by trying to act well.

Still others remain as frustrations to confound the earnest. These only give way to insights and realizations. Genuine freedom begins to surface in one's being. This emotional and mental freedom enables one to take more natural actions, to express self-supportive, rather than self-destructive impulses. Health results naturally.

More on health to come.

If you absolutely cannot wait, read the following key pages of _In Search of the Miraculous_ by P D Ouspensky:
17, bottom, through 22, bottom
104, bottom, through 115
—begin and end with spaces in text (or end of chapter)
If the style agrees with you, begin reading the book from page 3. Skim through the esoteric science sections. The book goes back and forth from a high-school level conversation to nearly impossible to understand discussions of what seems like a kind of astrophysics or chemistry you never heard of. For example, nevermind most of the text around the diagrams in the book. That's just there to put you off, apparently.

_Introduction to Human Technology_ by William Arthur Evans, impressed me with this idea, especially about emotions, which have far more influence than the external conditions of health (diet, sunlight, exercise, etc). His idea connects the methods of Natural Hygiene (see Douglas Graham and Herbert Shelton) with those of all wisdom schools, including Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings.

#### a meditation on design

Having been staying with accomplished designer, [John Cruikshank][1]; having been engaged as a designer by his community during my visit; and facing a crossroads in my life around design, it is very much on my mind. So this is a meditation on design.

I am blessed with the ability to design things. I am also cursed with an accompanying awareness of how badly most things in our culture are designed, as well as a (thankfully waning) compulsion to correct them. In our culture, we have set it up so that our whole existence is dependent on design. Yet it is so fragile a process, so needful of time and listening, that in our rush, we usually do it poorly.

Due its delicacy, I have decided that design is simply not designed to be the foundation of material culture. It has a place in normal life, determined by necessity. Indigenous people, whose culture is largely shaped by necessity, are great designers, generally. Their lifestyle is simple, so they have enough time to design well the few things they actually need that are not there: shelter, weapons, a livelihood, rituals, and war tactics. And even then, they take many of their clues from animals (four-leggeds being twice the footworkers we are, I guess).

So our problem relating to design is neither the predominance of bad design (to be corrected with "education" or "effort" or some other such nonsense), nor is it that design as such is bad. It is just that design is bad as a cultural foundation. (It makes me wonder what isn't. As the physicist, Minos Kafatos, put it, "Everything causes everything.")

Then what is the place of design? My father visited it upon me, so I'm stuck with it. As proficient at it as I am, it is often a clumsy, awkward thing, probably best left to dreams, a little consideration and subconsciously arranged, happy accidents.

And yet, as both a habitual designer and long-time student of philosophy, I am in the habit of thinking in terms of essentials. As someone once said, "Man may not live by bread alone, but he sure as hell thinks so till he gets some." If design has a place in maintaining the order and balance of a normal life, then it must have a place in restoring it, too. Perhaps the nature of our cultural quandary holds clues to that place.

Our quandary is generated and justified by our culture's mythology. Our basic, cultural myth is that the world is incomplete or hostile or both and must be righted. Making it so amounts to building it, and design is the first step in building. This is why I say that design is the foundation of our material culture.

But the hopeless scope of our task is obvious when we compare what we know to what we would have to know to build a world suitable by our culture's standards. Our history compounds the disparity. As one designer of the Los Angeles freeway system later put it, "Each and every problem we face today is the direct and inevitable result of yesterday's brilliant solutions."

Our culture's goal is impossible. The only sensible thing to do in the face of the impossible is to give up. Then, to look for something possible to face. Of course, the possible, in an eternal universe, is the certain. Thus we have only to look around for something we already do and call it a day.

We are a people filled with longing for ideals and disdain for what actually happens. Noticing the stuff we do every day, apprehending the new context we're looking within, will take some time, like coming into the sun after a summer matinee.

While waiting for our eyes to adjust to the light, let us designers drum up attributes to look for. In a nutshell, let our new purpose have good potential to be interesting and enjoyable, and let it be something we do all the time, so we cannot fail at it, even when sad, bored or even occasionally evil. Hey, since our culture has turned over such an important job to us designers, then we at least get to write our own job descriptions. What I mean is, anything that fits these criteria will definitely not overtax our capacity for design. The rest of you can buckle down all you want.

While I'm at it, let it require little or nothing more than already exists in nature. Let our return to it be slow and easy, served by the strange skills we have learned and the amazing things we have produced on our way to Eldorado.

As a last source of clues, let's look to the beasts. What is it that they are all doing all the time, which they seem to find interesting and enjoyable? And what of the humans who approach the joy and grace of the other animals: what do children do? What do the indigenous do?

Now, I'm just a brushdweller from Idaho, and I admit to starting campfires with sage and then farting into them, two of the most stupid and dangerous things a boy can do. But ridin' by on a mule, it looks to me like all these creatures are _just living_.

#### a drive-by analysis

We begin with _The Edukators_, an excellent German film from 2009.

> EXTERIOR. MOUNTAIN CABIN. DAY.
>
> Twenty-something JAN and his two anarchist accomplices are hiding with their captive, the bourgeois HARDENBERG. Like his kidnappers, Hardenberg was once a young radical.
>
>> JAN

>> How can someone with your past live the way you do? You must have had ideals.
>>
>> HARDENBERG
>>
>> My father told me, "Under 30 and not liberal, no heart. Over 30 and still liberal, no brains."
>>
>> JAN
>>
>> Yeah, right. But I don't believe that crap. It's the standard excuse of guys like you.
>>
>> HARDENBERG
>>
>> It happens slowly, gradually. You hardly notice it.
>>
>> One day, you abandon your old car. You want a dependable car, with air conditioning, a warranty.

>> You get married, raise a family, buy a house. The kids need a good education. That costs money. Security! You create endless debts so you need a career to pay them. So you do like they do.
>>
>> Then one day, to your surprise, at the polls, you vote conservative.
>
> (scene)

In this little myth, which today, billions live out (or want to), Hardenberg gives a neat summary of the mechanics of mass slavery in global industrial fascism, especially in its developed economies.

Though every item he mentions serves a necessary function of life, its form is corrupt, inapt, artificial. All of these forms arise from the mass psychosis of civilization in its modern mode. Life presents no objective demand for these psychotic forms. All of them (see first column) can be retired and replaced by sane, natural systems (in the second column) that are cheaper, easier, more effective, and more enjoyable by 2-3 orders of magnitude:

| psychotic | sane |
| --- | --- |
| car | walking, backpack, rolling suitcase, handtruck, bicycle & trailer, pack animal, car coop, bus, boat, train, zepellin |
| marriage | love |
| nuclear family | extended family |
| house | simple shelter |
| education | freedom & adult availability |
| state money | mutual credit, frugality, natural abundance |
| security | sociality |
| debt | simplicity, harvest-based livelihood |
| career | pursuing multiple interests and genuine talents |
| selling out | selfhood |
| partisanship | common sense |

Throughout my writings, I have tried in various ways to expose the articifial forms and present the natural ones, eg, [Tribal Housing](/other-writings/tribal-housing). Since the house is the most expensive and isolating item above, it anchors our slavery within this system. The house necessitates the other elements. If you have a house, you must get a job to pay for it. To get to work and psychically buffer oneself against its impositions, one likely requires a car.

The trap is set. The house becomes nothing more than a personalized prison cell entailing 30 years of indentured servitude. Observe that "mortgage" means _death pledge_. Servitude, in the form of a job, leads to time-scarity and parental neglect. The car is the gateway drug of consumer financing and global devastation (as well as a portable Russian Roulette game for the whole family).

Social isolation erodes security. Fear leads to credit card shopping sprees. Debt engenders dreams of freedom, at least for one's children. Ironically, parents force these dreams on their offspring. Thus, we arrive at education and selling out. One ends the fiasco at the polls, where one tries to compensate for this lifestyle with a indignantly righteous opinion about who should be left holding the bag.

Inasmuch as these are all more or less corollary factors arising from pandemic [psychosis](/darkness-conjecture/psychosis), I suppose the causation could be switched around. One fellow I talked to recently said it is the pursuit of a career that leads to everything else, due to the college debt a career entails these days. I was raised by an architect, and I'm cheap, so I'm biased towards the house argument. Maybe it would be better to start with conformity. Or something not on Hardenberg's list, like a family disaster: a death, catastrophic illness/accident, or bankruptcy. That's fine, but these pieces come into play in our lives one way or another. And radical analysis leads to the same conclusion: no one needs any of this crap.

#### an American art of placement

Nature structures things in ways that work. These ways translate into methods of arranging built environments that embody order, circulation and serenity. Feng shui, the Chinese art of placement, is one such method. Here, I introduce ORDO, an American art of placement. It is a simple, native way of evoking these often elusive qualities and breathing new life into Western spaces.

ORDO (Latin for _order_) derives from the basic, physical facts of nature and the relationship between them: _there are entities, and space surrounds them_. From this single axiom of ORDO flows its three principles and a handful of clear techniques. Once grasped, they reveal their workings through thoughtful practice. I have expressed them in terms of furniture settings and walkways in rooms, but they apply to any scale of placement, from cities to bric-a-brac, and philosophical ideas to social organization.

The first principle of ORDO is _centered setting_. This means placing a setting toward the center of a space, and confining walkways to the edges. This principle embellishes our axiom thusly: _entities are relatively still, and the surrounding space contains movement_. For example, planets are surrounded by space and satellites; a tree by air and birds. ORDO distinguishes and separates these two elements of a room and gives each a place because they have mutually exclusive functions. It is why we drive on streets around buildings, not through them. (Sadly, the same sense bears not on the typical room arrangement. In the attempt to gain more space by combining the walkway with footways (areas for feet within settings), people put furniture against the walls. The room's middle, left empty, becomes the de facto walkway. Occupants loiter uncomfortably at room's edge, waiting for whatever else is supposed to occupy its center. Meanwhile, traffic, unacknowledged, takes over, disrupting relationship and depositing clutter. This gives most American rooms all the serenity of a train station.)

The other two principles of ORDO are _engagement_ and the _compound square. Engagement_ orients a setting to a room's main feature (usually its main window) and its main entrance. This engages occupants with the pleasure and the challenge of life, respectively. (_entities revolve around larger entities_). _Compound square_ puts a setting's pieces of furniture square with each other but at an angle off-square with the room. Having more sides and angles, the room seems more like a circle. And the slight tension thus created between the setting and the walls sets the room in motion (_entities are rounded and they rotate_). This generates stillness in the center, where occupants can finally obtain true rest or focus without obstructing movement; and movement and space at its periphery that does not disrupt the stillness. The subtly energizing results contrast dramatically with the lethargic restlessness of most rooms.

The techniques of ORDO facilitate the execution of these principles. First, determine natural walkways. They lay straight ahead of entries, mostly along interior walls, and opposite a room's main feature. They will lay around or between settings, not through them. Usually, they are 3′ wide. Whenever possible, put a room's entrance on the same side as its main feature and in a corner (multiple entrances in adjacent corners). Make inwardly swinging doors latch toward the corner (and vice-versa).

Second, put settings in areas left open by walkways. Border 2-3 sides of a setting with the window and adjacent walls and the other 1-2 sides with walkways. Footways almost always lie perpendicular to walkway. This makes settings orbitable, letting people approach, enter or pass them by without disturbing them. ORDO asserts that your place exists for you: for who you are and what you do. Peel your furniture off the walls; group it in the center of the room; banish the walkway to one side; and finally take possession of your rooms.

Third, face a setting between a room's window and its main entrance. In common rooms, more toward the window; in private rooms, like bedrooms and offices, more toward the door. Start with the main seating of the setting-to-be. Anyone sitting anywhere in an arrangement of a sofa and loveseat should be able to see both the window and door merely by turning her head. Place the setting at an angle off-square with the room, usually 10-15 degrees (which suffices to make the room move again) but as much as 30 degrees. Position the rest of the furniture square with the first piece, perhaps adjusting the angle. (Angling furniture wedges space between furniture and walls, and thus also reinforces the principle of centered setting.) Place little or nothing before windows, especially opening ones. Lying face-up in bed or sitting at a desk, one can see both the door and a window without turning his head. Windows in these cases are more to one's sides. In a large room, shelves (as partitions) and rugs define a setting and are square with the room. In a small room, they are part of an off-square setting (shelves in rooms' corners). A setting includes lights and plants at its corners, where they also function as screens between a setting and a walkway or another setting. Within a setting, place lights toward a room's center, and plants, toward a room's corners.

Fourth, eliminate the clutter the process has exposed. ORDO brings everything out into the open. It necessitates and enables our dealing with hidden and ignored things. Now that the structure of the room does not trap clutter, put it away, throw it away or find places for it (the odd angles of the settings create inconspicuous, convenient nooks for small furniture and bric-a-brac). The garbage bin and resale shop are integral parts of this process. Dispense with what you cannot easily keep in place. Reduce and condense possessions according to necessity. Let ORDO pay for itself immediately through the sale of unneeded stuff.

ORDO will move your furniture and belongings—and your psyche with them—to a degree difficult to believe. It removes the cause of your having to unconsciously change all the time for the sake of unconsciously placed furniture, often left where the movers put it down. ORDO brings _unchange_, a reversion to natural order, an end to the internal and behavioral compensation we constantly make for poor design and arrangement. It catalyzes a relaxation and surrendering to things as they are. It is a tonic, it is exciting, it is unexpected. It unveils the vitality in you, in your shelter, and in your relationships with the people who share it with you.

#### a design for a full life on $250 a month

\[**NOTE:** While the mechanics of Tribal Housing as described below are still mostly valid, my thinking about the social context of TH has changed significantly. While I have slightly edited the article to reflect this change, please read [Sociality Undenied](/other-writings/sociality-undenied/) for a full presentation of my new view of social organization (subsequently obsoleted by the ideas in [psychosis](/darkness-conjecture/psychosis/) and [hygiene](/hygiene/)/capacity\]

#### Introduction

After people, shelter is our most immediate need. In our culture, it is also the greatest of our obscene expenses and a heartbreaking damper on our tribal sociality. In this article, I present a design for a new kind of house, which reverses this condition and restores our people, our shelter, and our work to their natural places in our lives.

Tribal Housing is subsistence-scale shelter which a group of people makes together for itself. In other words, it is exactly like the forts you built with your childhood friends, except it takes a bit more time, you can actually live in it, and your friends do not have to go home after dinner. The house's design is a set of principles, attributes, and measurements you can adapt to any setting. A small group can itself plan and build it quickly and for an astonishingly small amount of money. It works in the city and country, with buildings existing and new, owned and rented, and with any material and method of construction.

The house makes room for the basics of human life: companionship and privacy, work and sleep, eating and sex, bathing and elimination, comfort and recreation. In operation, 4-24 people use the space typically occupied by 1-8 in a transformable, tribal way. Transformable means that the interior areas are rearrangeable and of multiple use. They are defined and set with modular, transformable, collapsible, and transportable walls, fixtures, and furniture. Permanent, interior walls and built-in features are in absence as much as possible. The building itself consists of just the floor, roof, exterior walls, and the empty space within. Tribal means that we live together on the basis of innate human sociality, according to our activities, for the purpose of making a living together. In contrast, civilized means people's joining together because they believe the same way (like- minds), for the purpose of achieving their ideal (as in community, that frail counterfeit of communion). A tribe attends more to action at the surface than agreement on fundamentals. This leaves people free to explore the depths when needed, in humility, alone or together, with much less political pressure. A tribe's foundation rests not on the shifting sands of individuals' values—claimed or genuine—but upon the immutable social nature of the human animal.

Tribalism thus diffuses power, mitigating hierarchy and meddling while strengthening both customs and individuals. Cool is its ethos; self-organization its mechanism. Capable, humble leaders emerge, as needed, among people with something to do together. Tribalism embraces and utilizes in people all that civilization would banish (eg, laziness, dissent, capriciousness). One's basic question in a tribe is: How can I help extend the living of the tribe to include myself? Always, there is something simple, obvious, and easy to do. A tribesman shows up and makes herself useful, letting time reveal her gifts. Things tribal neither begin nor end, rather, they are more or less in view. We all live tribally in some ways: from volunteering to, "Help us move, bro, and we'll smoke you out!" to making music in _bands_. It is instinctive and common sensical. It might take awhile to see it. Then it is incredibly fun to let it out.

There are many kinds of Tribal Housing for different environments, lifestyles, and livelihoods. A _dense residence_ is in a residential building, like an apartment or suburban house, for people with transitional, nearly conventional, and cult lifestyles and outside, part-time jobs. An _urban micro-village_ is in a large, unpartitioned space, usually commercial, like storage, a warehouse or storefront, for people with bohemian, metropolitan, and gang lifestyles; residents run tribal businesses and work at outside jobs. _New Tribal Revolutionary Quarters_ is in unused areas of occupied buildings: closets, crawlspaces, stairwells, spare bedrooms, sheds, etc. It is for hyper-frugal entrepreneurs, students, and activists on a mission, living on the edge in small groups, with permission (if not the knowledge) of the buildings' owners._Street cover_ is in abandoned buildings, roofs, sewers, doorways, and tunnels, is for the Tribe of Crow (the homeless—see _Beyond Civilization_), taking shelter without permission or cost. A _rural micro-village_ is in the country or wilderness, usually made of small, separate structures, either stationary or portable (even tents), for people with nearly self-sufficient, permacultural, and hunter-gathering lifestyles. A_co-shelter machine_ is a highly efficient, integrated shelter-transport (eg, backpacks, bikes, buses, boats, balloons); its crew capitalizes on fleeting opportunities for money and adventure. In a _circus_, people's quarters and lifestyle are so outlandish, they are their own livelihood. Combinations of these work, too.

Beyond that lay exotic, Seussian, and Hundertwasserian realms filled with a mind-boggling variety of Tribal Houses. They are hexagonal, conical, geodesic, domed, and globular. They are liquid, elastic, spongy, mechanical, gyroscopic, anti-gravitic, and organic. They are underground, in trees, floating, stratospheric, sub-spacial, and submarine. They are made of wood and live trees, stone, metal, and glass; bamboo, mud, straw, fabric, paper, and rope; carbon fiber, rubber, plastic, holograms, and plasma. They are stationary and mobile, set in mountain caves and rockets to the moon, able to be carted by bike or assembled into a pedal-powered glider. As the Doctor might say, "Who knows? Let's go!"

#### Tour

_Dense residence_ may be the most available form of Tribal Housing. Yet it is usually provisional, so I will talk about it later, along with a little-known fact about Tribal Housing. The sustainable form of it within reach of most of us is the _urban micro-village_, so let's take the grand tour of an imaginary one.

\[**NOTE:** I have changed my mind about this. I now believe a _rural microvillage_, set either in the country or suburban backyards, has the highest chances of success. I have worked on structures for it in the last couple years. See my [photo gallery](http://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com/) and [links](/other-writings/links/)for more about this.\]

It is late spring. We are walking in the old industrial district of a mid-sized city, 10 minutes by bike from its civic, cultural, and commercial centers. We stop before a single-story building that could have been a small shoe factory or a printing shop. We knock and are shown in by a soft-spoken six year-old who then disappears to the right. The space is rectangular and long from front to back. Light streams in through the many, tall, side windows, and a few skylights, over fabric and wood huts in the back. The wood-floored, brick building is clean and in good repair. Interior walls are wood, fabric, and paper. Ornament is eclectic and cheery. Sounds come from every corner of the building: muffled ones from the back and clearer, occasionally loud ones from the front. Through the open windows passes a draft. Somewhere ahead, people of all ages play and talk, and others are enjoying their work in a hushed buzz to the right. Two grandmothers pass by us in silence on their way out. A youth catches up to them with a library book to be returned, which they accept with a smile. The place gives the overwhelming impression of being lived in.

We have entered the space left of center into the hallway. To the left is the cloakroom. It serves as garage and foyer. It has bike hooks, coat, and shoe racks, shelves, mailboxes, and a bulletin board. Opposite the cloakroom and on the right is the workroom. It serves as a workshop, office, and kitchen. It has collapsible, height-adjustable benches, a freestanding sink, hand tool bureaus, and shelves, all with locking casters. There is space for small appliances. Light curtains separate the dirty, clean, and food sections. The dirty section is airtight, ventilated, and has a door to the outside. Beyond the workroom on the right is the living room. It serves as living, dining, and family rooms, library, study, sanctuary, and stage. It has heavy curtains for walls, roll-up carpets, pillows, camp chairs, rolling shelves, and altar. Opposite the living room and on the left (and beyond the cloakroom) is the store. It holds food and supplies. It is curtained and has shelves and one of Papanek's $9 hand-cranked coolers.

The hallway jogs to the right and continues to the back down the middle of the building. Bathrooms are on the left and right, one per 4-6 people. They have lightweight fixtures, a counter, shelves, and ventilation. They have composting toilets and greywater drainage. Next are the private rooms, on the left and right, one per person. They are on the exterior walls and each has a window and usually contains furniture for sleeping, work and storage. They are small and cozy (like the forts we made as children), made of wood or plastic frames and modular, sound-dampening panels. Every piece of the house's interior is small and light enough that one or, at most, two people, can maneuver and install it.

Public storage lays throughout the house; private storage lays between or above private rooms; all of it usually accessible from the hallway. Plants sit and hang everywhere. Water runs from one or two spigots through the tribe's own half-inch, non-leaching PEX pipe and hose, along the ceiling, above hallways, and then down to sinks and baths. Water drains either directly to planters next to sinks or through 1 1/2″ plastic pipe running along the floor and out to holding tank and gardens. Low-tech, solar water, and space heaters face the sun from the roof and windows. Electricity is optional and then routed to just the workspace and not used for lighting (oh, the unimaginable delights of a life unscrewed up by electricity). Phone lines are optional. For light, the design specifies sunlight, oil lamps, candles, flashlights, and night-sleeping; for energy: hand-tools, bicycles, nanohydropower (water pressure), and finger-lifting; for heat: sun, bodies, extra clothing, insulation, and simple heaters.

We reach the back of the house and exit to the outside area. It is at least a third of the size of the space inside. It has an undug garden and workspace, lawn, fountain with pool, mud bath, and a fire ring. There is an awning and a ladder to the roof. We climb up to a resort in a sky forest. There are several, large, potted trees, a flower and vegetable garden, a lounge area, retreat huts, and solar installations. We take in the view and watch people on the street hurry by.


#### Background

So where did this come from? And how does it work? Well, there is something of my story in this.

Surrounded by freethinkers, designers, and craftspeople, I grew up thinking, imagining, and making things. Oblivious to the system's horrors, I got caught up in its designs for me. By 16, I had a bad feeling about everything. I constantly wondered what the hell was going on. When I shook off my slumber and perceived the world and its people being devoured by the culture I had been born into, I grasped its insanity. Then all that mattered to me was to understand, to trace what had happened, and to find some other way to live. After my release from school, I left everything I knew to recover myself and experience the world; to be with people and to travel; to read what I wanted; and to think, long and deeply. For years I have wandered, living out of a backpack, an emissary for a way of life I knew little about, just that I would find it.

I was buoyed by a strong memory from church camp at age 14: the experience of social intimacy. And I had a couple, reliable, guiding principles. One was obvious to me: there is nothing wrong with people or the world, and the whole Original Sin thing has been a long, bizarre detour. The other was a secret that led me along by indirection: life is not so much about what we do or how we do it, but what we do it for.

Growing up, I had caught glimpses of how indigenous people live, and an unshakeable question formed in my mind: Coming from industrial culture, how can I experience the simplicity and ease of theirs? Fate led me repeatedly to the work of Daniel Quinn (until I got it). After a devastating yet placid critique of our culture, he suggests living tribally, as the indigenous do: seeking satisfaction in the support of my people instead of the products of the system (aka _The Economy_). How? By making a living together (in a tribal business) instead of making money alone (called, fittingly, making a killing). He calls this modern use of ancient principles New Tribalism.

Over years of visiting a friend who had moved to, of all places, Las Vegas, I met members of Laservida, a band of guerilla artists. They, too, had long sought another way to live: "Way out youth looking for a way out," as one of their stickers put it. I introduced them to Quinn. We knew not what business we could do together. But we knew we needed a place, so in early 2001, four of us rented an unelectrified storefront in crack central, and began a crash course in power-free, New Tribal living.

The space only cost each of us $115 (about two workdays) a month and right away we had a place to be and to be together. That automatically generated other things we needed: something to work on as well as a place to make art in; the roof to sleep under and on; the food people would show up with; the walls to show art on; the salvaged desks to work at; the candlelit room to play music and dance in; the sanctuary in which to give up control… While I never had $250 a month, I felt happier (and better rested: no light at odd hours) than I had since I was five. With the help of my companions and elders, I finally saw that it is okay that I feel disinclined to achieve the perfectionistic megalomania known as the American Dream (what I call _More_); that another, simple way to live was finally at hand; and that by making money for two or three additional days each month, I could get everything I need (what I call _Enough_), to say nothing of restoring my waning self-esteem.

Then this summer, in my beloved home state of Idaho, I finally went to a Rainbow Gathering. Besides the love, freedom, and harmonious diversity in evidence everywhere, I was struck by the extreme simplicity of the camp's nearly sustainable infrastructure, built in weeks by hundreds for tens of thousands from onsite and cheap materials. It enabled us to easily feed, bathe, shelter, and entertain ourselves, without exclusivity, social hierarchy or much commerce. I had spent my youth collecting pieces of a shattered way of life, even as I was learning the great principle of order and design, _Group Like Things_. While carrying water to a kitchen one day, a vision of a new kind of shelter and social arrangement lighted in my mind, integrating all the pieces and giving rise to this design.

#### Specifications

Those are the origins of the house. Now let's look more closely at how it works. We will measure it in square feet, hours, inhabitants, and dollars. Perhaps we will see in its scale what the American sage, Heinlein, meant when he told us, "A difference in degree makes for a difference in kind."

Roughly then, each person has 150 square feet throughout the indoor areas of the house: 50 for privacy, 30 for hallways, 20 for living, 15 for working, 10 for storage, 5 for bathing, and 20 extra; a person also has 60 square feet outdoors: 20 for garden, 10 for lawn, 5 each for: work, fountain, sandbox/mudpit, and fire, and 10 extra. Any roof area is bonus.

In this rectilinear example, private rooms are 6′ x 8′ (if you do not know what that looks like, measure it out). Frames are of either small lodgepoles; dimensional lumber with small diagonal bracing; arched, flexible, plastic sprinkler pipe for vaulted rooms (with thick, quilted covers). Panels, quilts, and curtains are of wood, plastic sheeting, cardboard, foam, batting, and/or fabric. Bathrooms are 4′ x 6′, half the size of private rooms and made of similar frames and panels. Whatever the design, it requires only hand tools; simple, cheap, standard parts; and a sewing machine.

The reason everything is transformable is so the space can change with the group. I mean, what does shelter for a real human life look like? Tribal Housing gives us a chance to find out, to reshape it within hours of reimagining it, unhindered by an interior stuck in one place (we rearranged our space in Las Vegas five times in as many months).

The private rooms, being made of modular panels, are conjoinable for friends, mates, and families. A quadruple room could have its own bathroom. Persons can pay for extra rooms and, for that matter, extra bathrooms. With an awning, floor, and its own fourth wall, a room can also go outside or on the roof. In any case, tribespeople are less than 15 seconds away from each other on foot. We make room for special occasions like concerts and parties by folding up the furniture and partitions of the living and workrooms. Population growth is accommodated first by filling in the space, then acquiring more space, then by division in the manner of cells at a natural, maximum population, which I put at about 24, the size of tribal bands.

Marshall Sahlins, the anthropologist who, 30 years ago and without derision, revealed how much the indigenous actually work for their basic needs (1-3 hours a day), called theirs the "original affluent society." By living in this house with the limited goal of Enough (a small amount, as everyone knows), as opposed to the body-and-soul-eating goal of More, and with the judicious use of our culture's "labor-saving devices", we, too, need only work one or two days a week, four to nine a month. This allows one to enjoy nearly any kind of work for money and leaves 20-odd days to figure out how to do it better next month, a place to do it, and people to do it with. It is an early retirement, a permanent sabbatical. It allows time to relax; to explore the range of one's interests; to solve one's perennial problems; and to release the illusion of total fulfillment as a human being through career and acquisition. It allows the time to enjoy the nearly constant company of one's people; to again see them as sources of pleasure and support—instead of as irritants and obstacles amidst the distress, shame, and sheer _shortness of time_ entailed by the pursuit of an ideal.

This is a tribal vision of life. It is a living we make in this house—a whole living. Most of it comes from just being together. The price of the rest, compared to that of More, is comically low. While living in this house, $250 a month is all you'll need to make your life go. Experienced DIY punks may scoff at this figure for being absurdly high. However padded, this projection comes out of our time together in Las Vegas and our years of separate experiences in and out of doors, money, groups, and jobs. Consider: a $1,000 place for three or four people drops below $100 apiece when split 12 ways. As for food, even a frugivore can eat well on $90 a month. Put away $15 for the unforeseeable. Use the remaining $45 for clothing, transportation, communication, and art. This covers thrift store clothing; maintenance of a good, used, road bike, and occasional bus and plane fares; stamps, phone cards, and library email; books, museums, guitar strings, dancing, and dollar movies. In accord with tribalism's attention to the _what for_ over the _how_, we, in New Tribal financing, reduce expenses rather than raise income. We learn and lead a variety of cheap activities, instead of paying to follow a few expensive ones.

The old factories and warehouses are beautiful and neglected, cheap and centrally located. It is fitting that the disenfranchised should find a home in them. If developers have beaten you to it (though it is hard to believe all the buildings are gone), seek further into the historic ghettos. They have always been home to tribal people and shared subsistence in cities. Cheaper than any "affordable" housing, Tribal Housing is also sustainable and repels both poverty and the gentry, making it attractive to locals (whose opinion will matter). Look for rents of less than $.50/ft2 and purchase prices of less than $25/ft2.

Just the costs of the repairs and simple improvements to the building and the investment in the interior structures remain. We can both salvage and purchase materials. Builders discard wood by the grove at construction sites; billions of small-diameter conifers in the National "Forests" need thinning; and civilized people abandon tons of useful stuff weekly (just stroll through nice neighborhoods the evening before their garbage day). We'll recover money for materials from both the savings on and proceeds from the expensive stuff in our lives, including cars. For permanent and structural improvements to their buildings, landlords sometimes deduct the costs of materials and labor from rent.

Techniques of [ORDO](/other-writings/ordo), an American art of placement, are useful in arranging a space: put its entrance in a corner (multiple entrances in adjacent corners); inwardly swinging doors latch toward the corner (and vice-versa); walkways lead around, not through, rooms, and furniture settings, which are toward a room's center; a setting faces the room's most attractive feature directly and its main entrance obliquely; settings are square internally and off-square with the room; clutter is revealed and eliminated. As in nature, still entities are thus neatly toward the center of space and motion.

#### Summary

There you have an _urban micro-village_ and the elements of Tribal Housing as they occur in one. It is their subsistence-scale and subsistence-function which make room for all of them to be present and to operate together. This is how the indigenous do it. And this is why, as Jean Liedloff observed, "they have a much better time than we do." (But enjoyment, I suppose, befits savages. In their pitiable ignorance, they cannot fathom the glory of our divine destiny: to martyr ourselves in non-stop, isolated servitude to the grandiose mythology of a system that, for 12,000 years, has defaulted on its relentless promises of deliverance from the very loneliness, poverty, and disease it causes. Alas.) Perhaps the most important thing to understand about TH is that it provides shelter, not living space. It gives protection from the elements and basic comforts. Otherwise, it will kick you back outside! Forget the lilies of the field; consider the Eskimos. Now, onward to _dense residence_.

Since most of us live in residential buildings, a _dense residence_ is widely and immediately practical. Basically, _dense residence_ is a regular house with less stuff and more people (that these are inversely related must be some kind of sociological axiom). We use ORDO, jettisoning the bric-a-brac and bulky, heavy furniture. The kitchen (minus anything conceivable), the dining room, and the garage become the workrooms. We partition bedrooms, remove their doors, and put two to four people in each one. Any extra room with a window (den, laundry room, large closet, attic), we turn into a bedroom and condense their functions into the main, public rooms. We make composting toilets outside. This way, we can as much as quarter our expenses (and workweek) and quadruple our opportunities and support.

_Dense residence_ has a couple, tricky things about it. First, residential structures, with all their walls and specialized features, lack flexibility and tend to continually require remodeling. Second, zoners and developers designed our residences as retreats from much of the activities in which we would engage in them. This will probably cause discomfort, both for us and for neighbors. Yet, we can at least live in_dense residence_ while preparing for a move to another form of Tribal Housing.

Now for the little known fact. Tribal Housing is already happening, quietly and on a wide scale. I guarantee that there are groups near you living like this, usually craftspeople, artists, activists, hippies, squatters, and the homeless. If you can find them, perhaps you can make a place for yourself among them. Remember the show-up-be- useful thing, which, finally, is the irresistible approach which evokes the tribal nature of nearly any situation.

That's Tribal Housing. So much for loneliness, inclement weather, and the grind. By working together, as tribes have done for eons, we are immediately able to have what we need. Without selling out. While interacting with the system. Without looking for it to crash. Without waiting for the entire world to get it. There is nothing to it. Get with three or four of your people, keep reading this article and website, and act immediately on what parts of it you now see clearly.

Find the latest version of this secret-dense article and other New Tribal writings online at [andrewdurham.com](/darkness-conjecture/conjecture/). It is in the public domain; please pass it on. Properly formatted and printed, it photocopies onto the front and back of a ledger-size piece of paper. Below, I have listed books that have informed the design. They are also guaranteed to clean your clock. To request help with design for your group or your inclusion on a Tribal Housing mailing list, write me at info@andrewdurham.com. To individuals with questions: before asking me, please reread the article a few times, sleep on it, use your own good sense, and talk with friends about it. Please let me in on what you come up with.

There is no, one, right way to create Tribal Housing. We can take minutes or months. We can do it bankrolled or broke, quick and dirty, or slow and precise. We can be few or many, rude or courteous, learned or just plain gung ho. However it happens, this house is a place for us, as we are.

They were always happy. They never got sick. They lived for thousands of years until they chose to pass on. They lived in harmony with the creatures of Earth and took their place on Earth without dominating or despoiling it. They were neither hungry, nor cold, regardless of where they lived or traveled. Some of them lived on sunlight and air. Others ate fruit and greens, fresh, ripe, raw, whole. In short, the Original People lived in complete accord with human nature. They lived in peace for tens of thousands of years.

Far, far away, a strange people from another dimension began a long journey toward Earth. These people were strange because they lacked all three dimensions that things on Earth possess. They were cardboard cut-out people. Two-dimensional.They left their dimension because they had learned and done everything they could there. They needed a place to continue expanding themselves as beings. So they headed for Earth where, as everyone in the galaxy knows, you can learn a lot really quickly. Their journey would take thousands of years.

Everything in the universe is made of energy which vibrates at different frequencies. Organisms have very powerful vibrations that travel long distances faster than the speed of light.

As the strangers approached Earth, their energetic vibrations began affecting the Original People. Things that had come naturally and effortlessly to the Original People began to slip their minds momentarily, then for longer and longer periods, until only their oldest and wisest people could remember. They began to cook their food, to hunt and kill animals for food, clothing, and shelter.

However, they maintained a strong connection to Earth, its cycles, its creatures, its spirits. Their elders kept ancient wisdom and secrets alive through unbroken lineages of shamans. The legends of Ancestors---the Original People---echoed loudly in the hearts, minds, and bodies of all of them.

Thus did Original People become Indigenous People: human beings vibrating at a frequency low enough to receive the consciousnesses of the approaching strangers.

The influence of the strangers especially degraded one group of Indigenous People. It was as if they had somehow lost their way as beings and as a people. Confusion, conflict, and sorrow showed on the faces of human beings for the first time in aeons. The wisdom of the people waned generally and became pronounced in a few, who began to make fearsome prophecies of an age of darkness to come. The feeling of inevitable doom began to impinge on the still strong benevolence they had always known.

Among these people, the first strangers incarnated. It was like the weak part of a body where it is easiest for a latent disease to become acute. Thus, few noticed or cared that these new children were different. They could not listen well. They did not understand quickly. They were afraid of ordinary things. They seemed shocked. They acted… stupid.

The elders took it as proof of the prophecies. They kept their confidence in the shamans, and held their children close as they always had.

The children, for their part, pulled away. During an especially lean year, one discovered the edibility of grain, an otherwise tasteless, malnourishing, and indigestible substance. The people began to eat large quantities of it. Psychologically rewarding chemicals in the grain began altering their feelings, their attitudes, their vitality to a profound degree. They felt dissatisfied yet complacent. They felt angry at no one in particular. They grew sick for no obvious reason.

Earth is a seductive, swirling kaleidoscope of impressions. For these strangers, it was a crash course. They knew nothing of being human except the little they managed to absorb from their people. The most developed of them was a thousand times less capable than the least capable Indigenous Person. And by now, the human body was far more intelligent than any of them. Being inside the body, each of these strangers began to learn rapidly how to be human in a few of the most gross and mechanical ways. They remained pathetically ignorant in the subtle ways considered most important by Indigenous People to this day.

What they found most fascinating were the forms and behavior of things. How rocks would fall out of your hand. How a stick would bang against the ground. How the flesh of a man or woman felt in ones hands. How things could be acted upon and changed. Their feelings were overpowering experiences. Frightening mysteries. But objects, at least, were clear. Simple. They began to master the manipulation and production of things.

Thus did these strangers, born of the Indigenous, become the Industrial People, always busy making things.

What drove them to make things? The malaise of persistent deprivation and fear, and their ignorance of the staggering abundance of Earth. Both magnified by their parasitic diet.

The further trouble with unchecked ignorance is that it leads to mounting errors. On Earth, multiplying, uncorrected errors have dire consequences. In this case, physical and psychic injuries. Untended, these injuries snowballed among the Industrial People. For the first time in aeons, human beings began to _suffer_.

Yet this felt somehow right to the Industrial People. An organism too advanced to tolerate Industrial consciousness _needed_ further degradation and impairment to lessen the friction between their differing grades of body and soul. Justified in their way of life and ignorant of others, they persisted in it. They took pride in this righteous process of hurting each. They would come to call it _civilization._

In their suffering, they felt afraid and alone. Their fear led them to feel angry. Their growing mastery over plant production had increased their numbers. Their people needed more land.

So they began to take it from the Indigenous, even to kill any Indigenous who would not join them. Anyway, this killing was strangely satisfying for the small cults that led the fights.

The people began to move farther north and south, where survival became an even greater issue for them. Along with their increasingly sophisticated technology, they began to develop sophisticated ideas to explain their lives. They developed codes and laws. When things went wrong---and they were always going wrong---it was not because their way of life naturally led to disaster. No, now it was someones _fault._

Many Indigenous People began to die. Earth being their home, they were reborn as the children of neighboring bands. Bringing their recent experience of Industrial People with them, they influenced bands to become tribes---larger, stratified groups with somewhat more ability to defend themselves.

Soon, Industrial People spread throughout the globe. Indigenous Peoples died by the band, the tribe, the nation. As they died, they were reborn, now more and more as the children of their conquerors. The old wisdom they carried began coming out of them in ways simple and profound. As philosophers and saints. As artists and scientists.

As a result of receiving this wisdom from people they considered their own, Industrial People learned faster both how to appreciate life and how to manipulate things. The errors of their ways multiplied along with awareness of their suffering. The extremity of their circumstances intensified as cultural development became more complicated. Saints began emerging more and more to help people ease their suffering. Elders of Indigenous Peoples still living began to reach out to Industrial People as kin, as truly, many of them were.

Indigenous People---both those still in semi-intact indigenous ways and those reborn as Industrial People---also simply grew tired of the absurdity of the situation. They longed for the Old Ways. To restore them, they mounted new efforts.

The sciences of Industry began overturning many of its destructive myths in persuasive ways. For example, the sciences of anatomy and physiology eventually produced a singular discovery: human beings are naturally frugivores. This means humans share the anatomy, physiology, and diet of other anthropoid primates who eat predominately fruit as well as significant volumes of leafy greens and small amounts of fatty and proteinacious foods. In light of 10,000 years of civilized grain, meat, and dairy eating, and tens of thousands of years more of indigenous root, meat, and cultured food eating, most Industrial and Indigenous People found this idea very hard to accept.

But there it is. Out of the Industrial impulse to move forward, and the Indigenous impulse to move back arose a deeper impulse to go nowhere, to be here, to finally discover the exact nature of life in this body, and fall through its trapdoor, hidden here in the open, in a childs relish for fruit.

For some Industrial People, this discovery bore a profound implication: that there had to be a time when all people ate this way. And this meant that there had to be a _third_ way of life beyond the Industrial and Indigenous ways in front of them. There had to be an Original way.

Some tried to eat this way. Physically, it felt good. Emotionally, many found it rocky. Some were thus motivated to discover, both through personal experimentation and in spiritual traditions, various ways to help restore the simple feeling of connectedness with Universe and awareness of more of its dimensions than the ever-fascinating physical one.

Small groups of people around the world experimented with long periods of rest in totally dark rooms. Significant rates of success in healing from the ancient psychic trauma of Industrial existence attracted some among the disaffected to retreat in darkness. Entire villages were retrofitted as sanitoria for this purpose. Word of the effectiveness of this approach quickly spread around the globe and quickened the forces of the Resolution.

Masses of Industrial People began awakening to their identity with Indigenous People, to their natural place on Earth. The persistent beauty and wisdom of Indigenous lifeways, combined with disasters caused by the Industrial way of life, spurred some of these awakenings. The old Industrial guard held on to their power to the last. Vast lies and armies propped them up longer than most believed possible. Many more people, animals, and forests died. But the people of Earth---the Indigenous, the maturing Industrial, the rediscoverers of the Original---prevailed in the Great Conflict. This was not due to their greater might, but their greater ability to participate in the cosmic forces that no system or machine could overcome, the forces that had assured from the beginning of the cycle a sane Resolution to the strife that would temporarily overcome humanity following the Catastrophe.

Many years followed of sharing and reconciliation between Indigenous and Industrial People. Industrial People actually learned to become Human Beings. Indigenous People continued to learn and, for a time, use some of the best of Industrial Peoples discoveries. One of their favorite inventions was the geodesic dome. And they were surprised at how glad they felt to stop killing their brother and sister animals just to be fed.

Satisfied with their time on Earth, Industrial People ceased to reincarnate here in order to continue their travels and learning elsewhere. Some Indigenous People left with them to share the terrible adventure. Some Industrial People stayed with the Indigenous to continue Being Human. Because it is wonderful.

Earth began to open up occasionally and swallow the fading Industrial cities, crushing and melting them back into its core. The gigantic wounds and poisonings Industrial People had inflicted on Earth slowly healed. Forests and oceans regenerated. Extinct species began to reappear from the morphogenic fields of the subtle dimensions of Earth. The seeds of fruit were planted by the hundreds of millions until they again covered the globe.

After several generations of living in an increasingly Original way, the first Blindingly Beautiful children were born to the Indigenous. They felt only love for their parents and their people. They instantly mastered everything they were shown and then began demonstrating new abilities. The ancient wisdom and stories of the Indigenous began playing before the people in the persons of these children, the new Originals of the species.

For tens of thousands of years these new Original People flourished around the globe. The paradises of Eden, Shambala, and Eldorado all emerged again, not in cities, but in the persons of the people, animals, plants, air, light, stones and water that inhabited them.

One night, a child spotted a new star in the sky. Over generations it grew brighter. It was red. And the People, first for moments, then days, began to forget certain things they had, as children, learned by heart.

The Great Hoop rolled on, round and round, again and again, forever and ever. Behold: Earth, where life burns bright and fast but never goes out, one generation to the next.
















### long return

The people were dying. We had tried everything. Welcoming, guiding, trading, sharing, talking, debating, running, sabotage, hiding, fighting, alliances, dividing, enduring. Nothing worked. The smelly soldiers were never satisfied. Fire and blood did not stop them, and when they had finished us, they would seek more.

So we waited. They would come, and we would fall. We were exhausted. Still, we had to think of the future. It is the job the world gave us. To think ahead, to anticipate, to see, to bring balance in time. We felt something terrible was coming. We had no idea how bad it would be.

All that was left to us was to understand. Why had this befallen us? What was wrong with us that this had come? What moved in the angry soldiers?

Some of us would go and keep our places in the next world. Some would come back. So we thought we would take aim from the next world and return as the children of our conquerors. To grow up among them, always strangers, but close enough to feel in our hearts what moved in theirs. To live and see as they do. And one day, perhaps, to understand our shared tragedy from their side.

As we did so, we would remember who we really were. We would leave our adopted families and somehow find each other again. We would share what we had learned from behind our masks. At last we would find understanding and then, perhaps, a way through, a spot to stand on and bring balance again.

The world is our home. We will not abandon it in its time of need, after the many rounds of peace and plenty we knew. We do not understand this cycle. Not yet.

#### 1992-93

##### Existence

I am full to bursting  
I am a dandelion drooping with dew  
I am my swollen lower lip and quaking eyes,  
lusting for her flesh and loins

I am a cat tensed to pounce  
I am my skin stretched tight and tingling  
over clean sinew and bone  
My muscle strands stream over them  
Like the river over stone

And it comes  
Finally  
To the sea  
I am awash  
I am alone  
I am come to me

##### Axioms

Words I cannot hold  
For the stars shine right through them  
It is the stars that I contemplate tonight

They are steady and quiet  
While meteors and eclipses  
Bustling this way and that  
Fawn for attention

Their presence is subtle and final  
To those who look  
They are indifferent  
To those who see  
They are obliged

Seeker  
Pause  
There is breath beneath your breath  
And words  
Beneath the words which escape you  
Words that should  
In every waking moment  
Hum in your head

In stillness  
One falls  
Touches old bruises  
Exhaustion  
Longing  
And returns to the meanings of those  
Underwords

##### Who Needs It

– to the memory of Ayn Rand

By definition  
I am conscious.  
Correct

It can work  
Only one way  
It: everything there is  
What is it?  
Name it  
The feeling of identification is pleasure  
And nothing can alter that fact

I wanted so much to want  
I could not break any laws  
Then what?  
Which way?  
What had scattered the signs  
From the roads that lead off from here  
Could it mark them again

The thing to pull it all together  
What would it be…  
What would it be?  
By definition  
Philosophy

##### My Father Lives in Twin Falls, Idaho

I am not the kind  
Who can walk down a main street with impunity  
My body is a monolith  
My blood stands still  
The numbness is a forcefield  
Which a draws a dangerous man close to me

I am going to the open desert  
For safety  
To be worn clean  
So that I may never have to walk down a main street again

##### Right Now

The very best thing possible is happening  
I am living

Food falls down my throat  
And my chilled flesh  
-it does not go to the bone anymore-  
Warms in this temporarily benevolent fluorescence

I have just enough time to regain my direction  
And the will to reenter a damp canyon  
Where again  
I'll find the courage to sleep

To walk a mile  
To go from this glow  
To trees and a moonlit creek  
Is to crumple into the hand of a giant  
Who rests a world away

I am ready  
This was worth six bits

##### Disguise

I have collapsed into depravity  
By way of prodigality  
I hoped that you are fooled  
And I hope that you are amused  
By my efforts to nobility

Mine is the disguise of a spy  
Who is about to depart enemy territory  
For the last time  
He is tired  
More and more  
He feels that he did not penetrate it  
But that his own fatherland  
Deeply screwed him

Ergo the appearance of a wastrel  
Yes, I've squandered the money I've earned  
But what I've been given  
I've spent well

Now  
I've laid the plan  
And collected the gear  
I am vacating my place here  
Listen for a whoosh  
Then a crash  
An implosion, I think  
Will be a fitting end  
To this place and this mask

##### Man

No proper adjective  
No possible qualifier  
Common: Contradictory  
Independent: Redundant  
Pluralization: Impossible

Exclusion of the unwilling  
By definition  
His identity  
Free, alone, complete  
A city-state-nation unto himself

This...  
...  
Quiet, he says  
The mob absent  
The comportment of his soul  
Named

##### The Words

Hear now the words  
Which beseech thee to perceive their origins:  
Freedom  
Heaven  
Life

Dumb and still you were  
Till their vibrations  
Cohered inside your head

Flowering language  
Trumpeted from every peak  
Drowns if a child whispers them  
In some lonely glen

The crickets and the wind will cease their own movements  
And conspire to aid him  
Lifting his feet  
And covering their fall amidst enemies  
Who writhe and languish all around

First the air into the lung  
To start the friction for the tongue  
To forge into a rapier drawn  
Thy thoughts! behold thy foe hast gone

No potent threat can be heard  
By the one who seeks and speaks these words

##### May I have this last dance?

I have my secret  
And I am going  
Do you hear?  
I am going, I am going!

At last the boat docks and I depart  
The oars and sails are my spokesmen  
Do you listen?  
They bid you adieu

You needn't hear me say it again  
For I am going  
A thousand, thousand times you've heard it from me  
But now it is true

I am going  
I am going  
I am gone

##### untitled

In the dark  
In the deep  
In the stone  
In the keep

There is I  
With the key  
And the sky  
Envelopes me

The sea's drops  
The Earth's rocks  
The jetty heavens  
Time stops

Breathe in, breathe out  
The seething din and the shout  
Resonate in the settling calm  
The tones, now heard  
now dancing in my palm

##### Planet and World

Never have I considered these things as the same

Here is the planet, Earth  
I can touch it  
And live here  
It sings to me  
And if I break a limb  
I bury it  
And cease eating  
And rise in three weeks  
Whole

There is this world  
—a coalition of polities on a planet—  
In which people live unsecretly  
There, we cannot hide what we are, what we do  
It all comes out  
It is all there  
And look at it

Then there is the world that could be  
Another world  
Separate or greater  
A world of freedom  
That one can found

Tinder gathers on its blueprint  
Some now aim their sparks there  
A breeze collects itself

You will see others smeared with grey  
Some walking  
Some dead  
Before the rains, everything will be grey  
This new world will rise  
From ashes

#### 1999 – present

##### Eating Bitter

I see every truth  
And every falsehood  
Resolve to truth

Finally I am fed  
By all this bitterness  
For it was salt that grew it  
Salt and humus  
The blood of so many gone before

Including me  
Yes I was here before  
I wept and died here countless times  
Horses would crush my body  
And kick it into the canal  
Where it would catch  
On branches and barbed wire  
And decompose into beds  
For native flowers that never bloom  
And malva and sheep sorrel and fat hen

That today  
I sit by the water  
In the seat of longing  
And eat  
And eat  
Until the hunger is satisfied

Twin Falls 1999 Jul

##### Not Quite

What happens  
If I tell you  
That ecstasy always plays at my bones  
Catches my breath  
Wipes out history?

What will it be for me-  
Cross or scaffold?  
Do you have any idea  
How much you hate purity?  
How ferociously you cultivate  
the drama of pain and achievement?

But this only provokes  
Your "Work,"  
As if, somehow,  
God left something undone.

##### Grass's benediction

Grass is benediction  
To my feet

I had forgotten  
Shoes clogged my brain

If you're strong  
You can eat it  
Said the tough-footed boy

Across the valley  
Bare-limbed disiduous trees  
The beard of the hills

And the clouds  
Write themselves  
On paper

##### Audience With Myself

If I could meet myself  
At this point in my life  
I would place all my hopes in myself

My secret longing for the sacred  
Would find second wind  
In the clues falling from my lips  
In the excited tension throughout my back  
In my sweet wish to make love  
To marry any one  
Of the beautiful, perfectly loveable women I meet everyday  
Everyone of whom I feel myself falling in love with

I would throw myself at my feet, sobbing,  
Deliver me! Deliver me! You are my only hope!  
I would beg all the saints  
Disguised as the ordinary people  
Who surround this self of my present  
Please help him to help me,  
To remember me  
Remember all his own failings, which I am  
Remember everything that led me to this point  
Remember everyone like me  
Sobbing at our own feet, Deliver me! Deliver me!

If I could meet myself at this point in my life  
I would place all my hopes in myself  
Seal my love  
For myself, for life, for others, for this lovely Earth,  
Seal it in wax  
Feed it to the flame in the hearts  
Of all ourselves  
Whom we might now meet at this point in our lives  
Again and again and again and again

LV 2001 Mar

##### 1.19.02 4 b

Did I storm your yard?  
I bid you relax  
Then caught you off guard  
Now I know the facts

Now your face is too much  
Only your feet can play in my mind  
These I can see and touch  
Without going numb or blind

These rhymes spring from love  
Won't you believe this old heart?  
Fly to me flitting dove  
May we nevermore be apart

You are wine, I, a drunken cup  
The sky opens and you pour down  
At the first red drops I look up  
At the receding blue before I drown

##### Kamikazes

When love becomes a life and death matter  
Even sweeping the floor is urgent

In washing the dishes  
the universe hangs in the balance  
Swallowing morsels of food  
stuns and dumbfounds even the quick and articulate  
A salad is a vision of god  
And just sitting down is an act of war

Who is the gremlin  
That gives things meaning?

It occupies my heart  
It has locked itself in  
It is making ransom demands  
It intimates that you are in its care  
But for how long!

These things cannot, however, concern me  
I lean back  
Let the sun hit my neck  
Like so many kamikazes  
Coming in

Seattle 2001 Dec

##### The crest and the trough

Waiting for an opening  
And then  
Into the breach

Endless controls  
Waffling toward zero

I touch a place now  
where I cannot  
Move against my feeling  
Anymore

Satloka 2004 Jan

##### Corduroy Classic 2001

– for Micha Grainger

Youth, man: that's IT  
Said Micha

Micha chases a lost rabbit  
The furbearer of his people  
Multiplying  
Soft  
Despised  
Elusive

See his comical corduroy cap  
His flaring pants  
The missing white member  
Of Fat Albert's gang  
Showing up late  
The party's second wind

Look!  
Old-school court shoes  
Improbably shined and flashing  
Twisting on the carpet  
Hands waving like daisies  
Laughter springing up goofy  
and hip:  
For the people  
For his people

Others chase their own dreams  
Micha chases the dream of his people  
Assured and fleet  
On his lucky furry feet

##### Breathe

There is no agency  
—let alone free agency—  
Only one long chain of life  
Binding us all to its winding course

Belong to it!  
Your strains against it  
Only pull it tighter against the rest of us  
Against we  
Who will bear it smiling  
Be assured

For what choice have we?  
Strain, do not strain:  
We belong  
It has us  
Has us

en route to Boise 2005 Aug 11

##### The Battle of Wounded Knee

– for Rob Bolman

The traveler of pregnant faith  
Sets foot on the distant path  
God is with him  
God is with him

Sing god's name with his  
God is everything  
And he is only dust  
Yet sing their names together

Many hopes follow on his heels  
Like friendly cats  
Longing pours from his eyes  
Unbearable tension rips his limbs from his body  
But he pulls himself forward by his chin and forehead,  
his abdomen and pelvis

God is with him  
God awaits him  
With prostheses that work better  
Than the arms and legs  
Of a born champion:  
This one will be made

Among the six billion cells of Maitreya's body  
This one finds his way home twice:  
in leaving and in returning

Godspeed, traveler,  
Closing his door and already far away,  
Godspeed.

#### Exactly Me

Exactly me  
Exactly me

The chains go round and round  
I fill the space with my empty head  
Stumbling and sliding through the night  
Lying painful in my bed

Exactly this moment  
And I'm turning side by fire  
And when I'm alone  
Oh no, again I'm alone  
Where this journey ends  
The sad-filled time expires

Exactly me  
Exactly me

No I see through this dance  
I insist its a trance  
And the moons they plod in their orbits  
The vampires coo  
No, nothing's new  
Still the morning falls all the harder

Chorus

This is nowhere to be  
When I don't know where to go  
I want so much to say yes  
But I wake up shouting no  
Dig in or retreat  
Forfeit or cast away  
Or quiet, hold your head  
There is a way

Chorus

#### A Candle for the Sun

I lost a candle to the rising sun  
Found myself doing things I'd never done  
I left my life as I knew it to rot  
I was selling things of mine I hadn't bought

This story begins in yesteryear  
A child sits in a corner of fear  
He has one match and a candle to  
To come up even he knows what he's got to do

He strikes the match and the room is lit  
His eyes adjust, take in bit by bit  
He moves the match closer to the candle  
And when the wick fires, that's his life's preambleee

Chorus

He pokes around, asks, What's this place about?  
Without a word, the bones reply, You should get out  
This room's a hole in the bottom of a pit  
But your flame is bright, just keep it lit

He cuts his knee and he wipes his brow  
He seeks the truth, he's climbing up and out  
The wick grows short, it burns his hand  
So what: hear the crack of dawn, feel the gust, it's open land

Chorus

#### Overcome

While my body stays in  
And my soul flies out  
I wonder why I'm singing  
When I barely know what I'm about

Brother said, Be cool, go slow, just hang  
Maybe I'll feel a change  
I trip, I fall, I feel wholly dumb  
Still, I keep my pretensions to overcome

It's the method, not the madness  
Though the words be transcendent  
Complicated by my false humility  
Juxtaposed with an arrogant tranquility

Chorus

Beaten and cornered, the boy will fight  
Then to survive is to know he's right  
If a door open up, he'll take his flight  
The wings of his mind free him from his might

Chorus

#### The Truth Is Mine to Know

Thank you  
But, no thank you

Oh, heal me, fire in the night  
Close these wounds and banish my fright  
Lead my from the darkness to light I've barely known  
Take this feeble heart and tell me what you've shown

I've given up my upbringing  
And all the lies therein  
I've broken through it singing  
I see my soul robed in the colors of heaven

Tearing through the falsehood  
Bearing all the truth it could  
It's here  
They say the truth is relative  
But the rock ain't relative

Thank you,  
But no, thank you

I'm alive  
I remember

#### I recognize I

If these tears are not mine  
Then my path you could define  
But I hear this wail as my own  
And so I cannot fetch your bones

I recognize I  
Until the day I die  
On that day I can no longer see  
I trust you to bury me

There is a picture of you and Father  
King-like he holds you as your eyes stream water  
Perhaps you were tripped as you chased your ball  
And his scepter could not break your fall

Now that we've sailed from his realm  
I think you've seen that one must man his own helm

What do you want of me, won't you just say?  
The sounding of brass must needs drive me away  
Act as my consience, you'll play to a shell  
This water's poison, find a new well

Chorus

#### Will

I don't got it  
But I want it  
I don't know what it is  
I just know that it's there

I will search it out  
And forsake my doubt  
I defy the mob  
And its doctrine of despair

Chorus:  
I am your child  
But I am still doing this  
Picking up what was your burden  
Gonna find my way to bliss

If you find this song a mystery  
You probably grew up with hope and history  
Hope that someday things will get better  
History of the fact that they never did

You question my anger  
You are amused  
It kind of makes me wonder  
Are your children confused  
About their desires  
And why they are here  
Cause that is just what happens  
When you're born in love and raised in fear

Chorus

I'm staking my life  
On a very dangerous thing  
On a 40 year old man  
Who knows about what I sing

Who'll give me the rites of passage  
And show me the work of his hands  
He'll call forth my spirit  
And I'll come forth a man

Chorus  
First verse

#### Descend

Gospel mission  
City street  
Ancient forest  
Public beach  
There I walked and I slept  
There I worked and I wept

Things fall apart

My sadness  
Sweet with age  
Staled to numbness  
Rotted to rage  
Rage melted to silence  
And silence became my cage

I'm not angry  
I am sad  
From myself it well  
But hiding has broken my back  
I've been shoveling coal in hell

Something bellows in my brain  
Like commandment from god:  
You were injured  
Unearth the pain  
It's buried under the sod

Things fall apart

Though I want you  
I beware you  
I will frustrate you ways of harm  
I am hurt some day I will trust you  
To hold me in your arms

#### Farewell

I don't care about getting ahead  
I just want to break even  
Yes you heard me right  
When I said  
After I've paid my debt, I'm leaving  
For good  
Did you ever think I would

So this is my leaving song  
I wish to say farewell  
I'll throw down all my possessions  
By a healing water well  
Watch the face in the shadowy water  
Hear it sing my namee  
Here the sound the I grew deaf to  
While playing this game

To the north woods or the deserts in the south  
Wherever I'm allowed to survive  
If to Earth, I'm a burden  
Let me drown in the river's mouth  
Better dead in harmony  
Than discordant and alive

And I'll be wild as a doe  
And watch the flowers grow  
Feel a desert heat wave roll  
Scorching some truth from my soul

I think they planned for my embittered wrath  
Strategically numbing me and diverting me from my path  
So I'm on my way, I'm getting off the beaten path  
Open up to the signs and find my way back

Chorus

#### Odyssey

Odysseys  
And time fell on a snowflake

I'm nearly done with farming  
Can you see the pines  
Waving you goodbye  
Citylife?

I am green  
With the sounds my bare feet make  
On the spongy leaves-will-be-humus

I twist at my ankles  
Bugs of joy  
Crawl in anticipation  
Up my tibia and fibia

Odysseys  
And time fell on a snowflake

More pine boughs  
Usher me to sleep  
At the tree's base

At the base of a tree  
In my Odyssey…

#### Minstrel's lullaby

Far away, far away  
I must go far away  
There is water whence I go  
Far away

O'er the hill, o'er the hill  
I will climb up o'er the hill  
I will quench my thirst  
I will drink my fill  
O'er the hill

But while I'm here  
Reason makes the rhyme  
The heart keeps the time  
The rooster tells us when to fall asleep

It's so simple it's so easy  
You can sit all night and grin  
And when the child knocks, you let him in

#### untitled love song

She is ready, she is Tona  
She says, I like you, I wanna…  
You know what I mean

Yes, I know what you mean all too well  
That's the garden where I was forbidden to dwell  
But if you hold the gate awhile  
I'll be along to share your smile  
And I'll bring you a rose  
A cutting for the garden

The sun sets, and you tire  
The wind through the leaves  
Like fingers on a lyre  
But tarry longer  
Let the gold fire wane  
I'm walking straight down the lane  
To bring you a rose  
A cutting for the garden

I come at dark, you look down  
You point the way  
I plant the branch in the ground  
There I sleep  
While you go off to bed  
In the morning  
You'll see the rose is red

And you'll bar the gate  
The entrance to the garden  
Where I want to live  
The rest of my life

#### Roots

Where are my roots?

I take off my shoes I take off my socks  
To find with my feet what we what I have lost  
I splash in the mud I roll in the dirt  
I run on the land that for roots must come first

Yeah, Mother  
Yeah, Father  
You gave shelter, clothes and food  
But you missed something  
Where are my roots?

I'm floating up my head's a hot air balloon  
Can't feel the ground if I don't have any roots  
I was driving through the midwest  
Behind a rest stop I ran  
I dove my fingers into the dirt  
Into the Earth  
Into the soil  
Into the land

Chorus

Walking weary by the edge of the road  
Thumbing for a ride  
Now roots for a displaced people  
Roots for them, they grow inside

Chorus

for my childhood neighbors, LaVerne and Jack Asher, on their 50th Wedding Anniversary

**2002 Jun 4**
LaVerne Asher and Mrs Nielson picked us up that day at the end of our run down the Salmon Falls River in a train of canoes. We, the Boy Scouts of Troop 69, were cold and wet, having endured a stormy spring day on an especially fast river. As usual, I was withdrawn and in shock from the physical demand of our outing. Ten years old and coddled, I was still possessed of the belief that no one should ever bear such trauma; that anyone, such as my Scoutmaster, Jack Asher, who subjected another to it was deeply misled and even dangerous.

It would turn out that life had more in store for me of what I faced that day. Many nights I was to spend alone and afraid in addition to being cold, wet, and tired. For I would choose, at 19, to live outside, off and on for 10 years, as I traveled the American West, contemplating my life and the world. My path twisted—and slowly untwisted me—just as the river twisted ceaselessly back and forth, throwing Mark Nielson, an expert canoer and my best friend, Jack, and me across its screaming currents.

Have you ever flown above flatland and seen a sinewave cut into it, shining and still? After rain in the mountains miles away, that still serpent is a raging dragon, though you would not know it from the air. Down in it, there is fierce water, two treacherous banks, the curves, and a canoe hurtling along, as straight as a cypressy waterway will allow. The only thing that compares to it is Woman Herself, but that's another story.

Mark, thank the river gods, was astern, steering us past the clutches of the rocky, reedy edges of the torrent. Once we cleared a turn, it was my job in the bow to paddle like hell for the other side, to lean out as far as possible over the water, and pull its frigid sinews toward the boat, drawing us to the right, then left, then right again. There was no sense in it, just muscle I've never really had, and a fear surpassed only by a heartbroken hatred for the man riding garbage, calmly guiding us and prodding us around the rocks he'd surely seen the wrong side of many times.

This was Jack, borne by the Spirit That Moves As All Things—across a war, his butcher's saw, the death of a son, and with an incomparably faithful wife—to anchor in me experiences that permanently defied my smallness and tendency to abstraction. Of course, he came for many of us, and I will never know a tenth of it, but that day, Jack gave me a memory that would save my life many, many times. He was God and he was the Devil. He was larger than life and he was a man. He was both compassionate and unsparing, as it was his to be, whether he liked it or not. I think he did.

LaVerne awaited our landing miles downstream in their grey beast of a pickup that usually sat ominously across my street, licking its chops for our next outing. Were we first out of the river? I think so. The cloudcover raced by in the wind and twilight. The door opened, Jack threw Mark and me in to be tended to by the women, then returned to the river to pull out the other boys and their canoes. With a total lack of the bemusement usually bubbling beneath her manner when she heard my complaints, which was often, LaVerne helped us out of our soaked clothes and into our sleeping bags. She had food and a way home for us. She presided over my return from the dreamworld: my body had sent me there to fetch some force to sustain it after giving out on the river. I commissioned the first daemon I encountered, collapsed, and eventually found out it had done my bidding. Jack had kept the daemon in line, and now Laverne dismissed it by calling my name, telling me how to move in the confines of the pickup seat until I could remember how to change clothes there myself.

Back to the river: it churned brown. It snaked through a long valley near Jackpot, Nevada. There was nothing else but its wet, stinging fire and my comrades for many miles in every direction. Just rocky, sagebrush-covered mountains more forbidding than the water. The only way out was through Jack and Laverne, by the grace of the sacred water that flows in their veins, that flowed into me that day.

I read and liked nearly everything else by Rand, Liedloff, and Quinn. Ouspensky's other books don't attract me. I have just started to study Graham, whose crystalline book on diet I have sought for over 20 years.

An honorable mention as a highly catalytic book that came at a critical moment in late 2006 is _Introduction to Human Technology_ by <a href="/blog/2009/08/william-arthur-evans/">William Arthur Evans</a>.

The book that concretely sums up for me the diabolical process of this culture, while enabling me to finally wash my hands of trying to remediate it, is John Perkins' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452287081?tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;adid=1CKF7AZ7XHPKT5B97ZD5&amp;">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a>.

There are also few other books that really affected me when I was first reading things on my own, starting at age 15. They prepared me for the books above. They are so close to me, it is hard to assess their monumentality, their greatness. Also, they are so central to my thinking, it is hard to objectify them, to separate them from my perspective as I have done in the above list. They are:

##### Good Designs by Others

#### Shelter
For their simplicity, ease, economy, strength, beauty, and elegance,
I recommend the following designs/methods for shelter construction.
(Speed measured in hours, days, weeks):

[Self-Strutting Geodesic Plydome](http://andrewdurham.com/formactive) (weeks)  
Steve Miller's perfection of Buckminster Fuller's design for a frameless sphere (now proudly hosted here!)

[Conic Shelter](http://www.fishrock.com/conics) (weeks)  
Chuck Henderson's sweeping, simple, brilliant, circled-square construction

[Hexayurt](http://www.hexayurt.com/) (hours)  
Vinay Gupta's 3-hour, $200, portable pop-up shelter + autonomous infrastructure

[Superadobe](http://www.calearth.org/) (weeks)  
Nadir Khalili's giant upside down coil pot shelters elegantly made from war materials

[Straw Bale Dome](http://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com/355) (weeks)  
my design for a frameless, superinsulated, catenary, corbelled, _cheap_ shelter, based on superadobe

[Cardboard Geodesic Dome](http://www.cccoe.net/stars/) (days)  
I started work on improving this. See pics of Seattle and Sweden Domes [here](http://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com).

The above designs are all **shell** constructions. That is, they are frameless. Why? Because frames should not be used to hold up materials that can hold up themselves. There is no integrity in that approach. I mean I find it a shame to put up a frame, then hang on it a rigid or semi-rigid material which can hold up itself and the whole building. While this approach _does_ have the advantages of requiring no imagination or economy on the part of the owner, builder, or designer, I have chosen frameless designs that embody: a dynamic elegance bordering on anti-gravity; simplicity any 5 year-old can grasp; and an economy any schmuck can achieve.

The two designs below are proper applications of the frame-and-skin method of construction. That is, there is a very lightweight frame that supports fabric or film, a thin, flexible material possessing only tensile, not compressive strength (nor their combination: cantileverage).

[Pillowdome](http://www.thegreencenter.net/pdf/dome1985.pdf) (pdf)  
Jay Baldwin's perfection of Bucky's Skybreak concept: a very light, "ephemeralized" frame-and-skin geodesic dome, with panels of noble gas-inflated fluoropolymeric (teflon/ptfe plastic) pillows. This ultimately led to the gigantic greenhouses at [The Eden Project](http://www.lookaroundcornwall.com/gardens-and-nature/the-eden-project.htm) in England.

[Warmlite Tent](http://warmlite.com)  
Jack Stephenson's masterful 2-5 person tents. He and his designs have had a huge influence on all my design thinking since 1995. Can you imagine, he went from being an insulation engineer on NASA space rockets to designing camping gear! After 40 years, his stuff is still decades ahead of its time. Only a few of his ideas have started to be copied in the last 5-10 years. I used to talk to him for hours on the phone while buying his gear and materials. Great guy.

#### Sites 

[Tribal Wish](http://www.efn.org/~wolfe)  
Adrian Wolfe's obscure, 10-year old, growing collection of essays on his 30-year quest to live in organic intimacy with others. This effort evolved into Gooble Dell, his home (and mine a few times in the past) in Eugene, Oregon, one of the oddest human menageries around. If Willy Wonka were a homeless man who camped inside a house inside a public park (true) with his friends (and a couple Oompa Loompas), this would be the house.

[EarthBirth Research](http://www.efn.org/~finnpo/ebr/)  
Finn Po's site on his multifarious, irrepressible, transcounter-cultural activities and visions. I got my first experiences with both darkness and domes from Finn while living and tinkering together at Maitreya Eco-Village, Eugene, Oregon.

### Origins of Agriculture

###### A Biological Perspective and a New Hypothesis

Greg Wadley and Angus Martin
_Australian Biologist_ volume 6: pp 96-105, June 1993
(re-published in _Journal of ACNEM_ 2000)

#### Introduction

What might head a list of the defining characteristics of the human species? While our view of ourselves could hardly avoid highlighting our accomplishments in engineering, art, medicine, space travel and the like, in a more dispassionate assessment _agriculture_ would probably displace all other contenders for top billing. Most of the other achievements of humankind have followed from this one. Almost without exception, all people on earth today are sustained by agriculture. With a minute number of exceptions, no other species is a farmer. Essentially all of the arable land in the world is under cultivation. Yet agriculture began just a few thousand years ago, long after the appearance of anatomically modern humans.

Given the rate and the scope of this revolution in human biology, it is quite extraordinary that there is no generally accepted model accounting for the origin of agriculture. Indeed, an increasing array of arguments over recent years has suggested that agriculture, far from being a natural and upward step, in fact led commonly to a lower quality of life. Hunter-gatherers typically do less work for the same amount of food, are healthier, and are less prone to famine than primitive farmers (Lee & DeVore 1968, Cohen 1977, 1989). A biological assessment of what has been called the puzzle of agriculture might phrase it in simple ethological terms: why was this behaviour (agriculture) reinforced (and hence selected for) if it was not offering adaptive rewards surpassing those accruing to hunter-gathering or foraging economies?

This paradox is responsible for a profusion of models of the origin of agriculture. "Few topics in prehistory", noted Hayden (1990) "have engendered as much discussion and resulted in so few satisfying answers as the attempt to explain why hunter/gatherers began to cultivate plants and raise animals. Climatic change, population pressure, sedentism, resource concentration from desertification, girls' hormones, land ownership, geniuses, rituals, scheduling conflicts, random genetic kicks, natural selection, broad spectrum adaptation and multicausal retreats from explanation have all been proffered to explain domestication. All have major flaws … the data do not accord well with any one of these models."

Recent discoveries of potentially psychoactive substances in certain agricultural products—cereals and milk—suggest an additional perspective on the adoption of agriculture and the behavioural changes ("civilisation") that followed it. In this paper we review the evidence for the drug-like properties of these foods, and then show how they can help to solve the biological puzzle just described.

#### The emergence of agriculture and civilisation in the Neolithic

##### The transition to agriculture

From about 10,000 years ago, groups of people in several areas around the world began to abandon the foraging lifestyle that had been successful, universal and largely unchanged for millennia (Lee & DeVore 1968). They began to gather, then cultivate and settle around, patches of cereal grasses and to domesticate animals for meat, labour, skins and other materials, and milk.

Farming, based predominantly on wheat and barley, first appeared in the Middle East, and spread quickly to western Asia, Egypt and Europe. The earliest civilisations all relied primarily on cereal agriculture. Cultivation of fruit trees began three thousand years later, again in the MiddleEast, and vegetables and other crops followed (Zohari 1986). Cultivation of rice began in Asia about 7000 years ago (Stark 1986).

To this day, for most people, two-thirds of protein and calorie intake is cereal-derived. (In the west, in the twentieth century, cereal consumption has decreased slightly in favour of meat, sugar, fats and so on.) The respective contributions of each cereal to current total world production are: wheat (28 per cent), corn/maize (27 per cent), rice (25 per cent), barley (10 per cent), others (10 per cent) (Pedersen et al. 1989).

##### The change in the diet due to agriculture

The modern human diet is very different from that of closely related primates and, almost certainly, early hominids (Gordon 1987). Though there is controversy over what humans ate before the development of agriculture, the diet certainly did not include cereals and milk in appreciable quantities. The storage pits and processing tools necessary for significant consumption of cereals did not appear until the Neolithic (Washburn & Lancaster 1968). Dairy products were not available in quantity before the domestication of animals.

The early hominid diet (from about four million years ago), evolving as it did from that of primate ancestors, consisted primarily of fruits, nuts and other vegetable matter, and some meat—items that could be foraged for and eaten with little or no processing. Comparisons of primate and fossil-hominid anatomy, and of the types and distribution of plants eaten raw by modern chimpanzees, baboons and humans (Peters & O'Brien 1981, Kay 1985), as well as microscope analysis of wear patterns on fossil teeth (Walker 1981, Peuch et al.1983) suggest that australopithecines were "mainly frugivorous omnivores with a dietary pattern similar to that of modern chimpanzees" (Susman 1987:171).

The diet of pre-agricultural but anatomically modern humans (from 30,000 years ago) diversified somewhat, but still consisted of meat, fruits, nuts, legumes, edible roots and tubers, with consumption of cereal seeds only increasing towards the end of the Pleistocene (e.g. Constantini 1989 and subsequent chapters in Harris and Hillman 1989).

#####The rise of civilisation

Within a few thousand years of the adoption of cereal agriculture, the old hunter-gatherer style of social organisation began to decline. Large, hierarchically organised societies appeared, centred around villages and then cities. With the rise of civilisation and the state came socioeconomic classes, job specialisation, governments and armies.

The size of populations living as coordinated units rose dramatically above pre-agricultural norms. While hunter-gatherers lived in egalitarian, autonomous bands of about 20 closely related persons, with at most a tribal level of organisation above that, early agricultural villages had 50 to 200 inhabitants, and early cities 10,000 or more. People "had to learn to curb deep-rooted forces which worked for increasing conflict and violence in large groups" (Pfeiffer 1977:438).

Agriculture and civilisation meant the end of foraging—a subsistence method with shortterm goals and rewards—and the beginning (for most) of regular arduous work, oriented to future payoffs and the demands of superiors. "With the coming of large communities, families no longer cultivated the land for themselves and their immediate needs alone, but for strangers and for the future. They worked all day instead of a few hours a day, as hunter-gatherers had done. There were schedules, quotas, overseers, and punishments for slacking off" (Pfeiffer 1977:21).

#### Explaining the origins of agriculture and civilisation

The phenomena of human agriculture and civilisation are ethologically interesting, because (1) virtually no other species lives this way, and (2) humans did not live this way until relatively recently. Why was this way of life adopted, and why has it become dominant in the human species?

#####Problems explaining agriculture

Until recent decades, the transition to farming was seen as an inherently progressive one: people learnt that planting seeds caused crops to grow, and this new improved food source led to larger populations, sedentary farm and town life, more leisure time and so to specialisation, writing, technological advances and civilisation. It is now clear that agriculture was adopted despite certain disadvantages of that lifestyle (e.g. Flannery 1973, Henry 1989). There is a substantial literature (e.g. Reed 1977), not only on how agriculture began, but why. Palaeopathological and comparative studies show that health deteriorated in populations that adopted cereal agriculture, returning to pre-agricultural levels only in modem times. This is in part attributable to the spread of infection in crowded cities, but is largely due to a decline in dietary quality that accompanied intensive cereal farming (Cohen 1989). People in many parts of the world remained hunter-gatherers until quite recently; though they were quite aware of the existence and methods of agriculture, they declined to undertake it (Lee & DeVore 1968, Harris 1977). Cohen (1977:141) summarised the problem by asking: "If agriculture provides neither better diet, nor greater dietary reliability, nor greater ease, but conversely appears to provide a poorer diet, less reliably, with greater labor costs, why does anyone become a farmer?"

Many explanations have been offered, usually centred around a particular factor that forced the adoption of agriculture, such as environmental or population pressure (for reviews see Rindos 1984, Pryor 1986, Redding 1988, Blumler & Byrne 1991). Each of these models has been criticised extensively, and there is at this time no generally accepted explanation of the origin of agriculture.

#####Problems explaining civilisation

A similar problem is posed by the post-agricultural appearance, all over the world, of cities and states, and again there is a large literature devoted to explaining it (e.g. Claessen & Skalnik 1978). The major behavioural changes made in adopting the civilised lifestyle beg explanation. Bledsoe (1987:136) summarised the situation thus:

> There has never been and there is not now agreement on the nature and significance of the rise of civilisation. The questions posed by the problem are simple, yet fundamental. How did civilisation come about? What animus impelled man to forego the independence, intimacies, and invariability of tribal existence for the much larger and more impersonal political complexity we call the state? What forces fused to initiate the mutation that slowly transformed nomadic societies into populous cities with ethnic mixtures, stratified societies, diversified economies and unique cultural forms? Was the advent of civilisation the inevitable result of social evolution and natural laws of progress or was man the designer of his own destiny? Have technological innovations been the motivating force or was it some intangible factor such as religion or intellectual advancement?

To a very good approximation, every civilisation that came into being had cereal agriculture as its subsistence base, and wherever cereals were cultivated, civilisation appeared. Some hypotheses have linked the two. For example, Wittfogel's (1957) "hydraulic theory" postulated that irrigation was needed for agriculture, and the state was in turn needed to organise irrigation. But not all civilisations used irrigation, and other possible factors (e.g. river valley placement, warfare, trade, technology, religion, and ecological and population pressure) have not led to a universally accepted model.

#### Pharmacological properties of cereals and milk

Recent research into the pharmacology of food presents a new perspective on these problems.

#####Exorphins: opioid substances in food

Prompted by a possible link between diet and mental illness, several researchers in the late 1970s began investigating the occurrence of drug-like substances in some common foodstuffs.

Dohan (1966, 1984) and Dohan et al. (1973, 1983) found that symptoms of schizophrenia were relieved somewhat when patients were fed a diet free of cereals and milk. He also found that people with coeliac disease—those who are unable to eat wheat gluten because of higher than normal permeability of the gut—were statistically likely to suffer also from schizophrenia. Research in some Pacific communities showed that schizophrenia became prevalent in these populations only after they became "partially westernised and consumed wheat, barley beer, and rice" (Dohan 1984).

Groups led by Zioudrou (1979) and Brantl (1979) found opioid activity in wheat, maize and barley (exorphins), and bovine and human milk (casomorphin), as well as stimulatory activity in these proteins, and in oats, rye and soy. Cereal exorphin is much stronger than bovine casomorphin, which in turn is stronger than human casomorphin. Mycroft et al. (1982, 1987) found an analogue of MIF-1, a naturally occurring dopaminergic peptide, in wheat and milk. It occurs in no other exogenous protein. (In subsequent sections we use the term exorphin to cover exorphins, casomorphin, and the MIF-1 analogue. Though opioid and dopaminergic substances work in different ways, they are both "rewarding", and thus more or less equivalent for our purposes.)

Since then, researchers have measured the potency of exorphins, showing them to be comparable to morphine and enkephalin (Heubner et al. 1984), determined their amino acid sequences (Fukudome &Yoshikawa 1992), and shown that they are absorbed from the intestine (Svedburg et al.1985) and can produce effects such as analgesia and reduction of anxiety which are usually associated with poppy-derived opioids (Greksch et al.1981, Panksepp et al.1984). Mycroft et al. estimated that 150 mg of the MIF-1 analogue could be produced by normal daily intake of cereals and milk, noting that such quantities are orally active, and half this amount "has induced mood alterations in clinically depressed subjects" (Mycroft et al. 1982:895). (For detailed reviews see Gardner 1985 and Paroli 1988.)

Most common drugs of addiction are either opioid (e.g heroin and morphine) or dopaminergic (e.g. cocaine and amphetamine), and work by activating reward centres in the brain. Hence we may ask, do these findings mean that cereals and milk are chemically rewarding? Are humans somehow "addicted" to these foods?

#####Problems in interpreting these findings

Discussion of the possible behavioural effects of exorphins, in normal dietary amounts, has been cautious. Interpretations of their significance have been of two types:

where a _pathological_ effect is proposed (usually by cereal researchers, and related to Dohan's findings, though see also Ramabadran & Bansinath 1988), and where a _natural_ function is proposed (by milk researchers, who suggest that casomorphin may help in mother-infant bonding or otherwise regulate infant development).

We believe that there can be no natural function for ingestion of exorphins by adult humans. It may be that a desire to find a natural function has impeded interpretation (as well as causing attention to focus on milk, where a natural function is more plausible) . It is unlikely that humans are adapted to a large intake of cereal exorphin, because the modern dominance of cereals in the diet is simply too new. If exorphin is found in cow's milk, then it may have a natural function for cows; similarly, exorphins in human milk may have a function for infants. But whether this is so or not, adult humans do not naturally drink milk of any kind, so any natural function could not apply to them.

Our sympathies therefore lie with the pathological interpretation of exorphins, whereby substances found in cereals and milk are seen as modern dietary abnormalities which may cause schizophrenia, coeliac disease or whatever. But these are serious diseases found in a minority. Can exorphins be having an effect on humankind at large?

#####Other evidence for "drug-like" effects of these foods

Research into food _allergy_ has shown that normal quantities of some foods can have pharmacological, including behavioural, effects. Many people develop intolerances to particular foods. Various foods are implicated, and a variety of symptoms is produced. (The term "intolerance" rather than allergy is often used, as in many cases the immune system may not be involved (Egger 1988:159). Some intolerance symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, hyperactivity, and schizophrenic episodes involve brain function (Egger 1988, Scadding & Brostoff 1988).

Radcliffe (1982, quoted in 1987:808) listed the foods at fault, in descending order of frequency, in a trial involving 50 people: wheat (more than 70 per cent of subjects reacted in some way to it), milk (60 per cent), egg (35 per cent), corn, cheese, potato, coffee, rice, yeast, chocolate, tea, citrus, oats, pork, plaice, cane, and beef (10 per cent). This is virtually a list of foods that have become common in the diet following the adoption of agriculture, in order of prevalence. The symptoms most commonly alleviated by treatment were mood change (>50 per cent) followed by headache, musculoskeletal and respiratory ailments.

One of the most striking phenomena in these studies is that patients often exhibit cravings, addiction and withdrawal symptoms with regard to these foods (Egger 1988:170, citing Randolph 1978; see also Radcliffe 1987:808-10, 814, Kroker 1987:856, 864, Sprague & Milam 1987:949, 953, Wraith 1987:489, 491). Brostoff and Gamlin (1989:103) estimated that 50 per cent of intolerance patients crave the foods that cause them problems, and experience withdrawal symptoms when excluding those foods from their diet. Withdrawal symptoms are similar to those associated with drug addictions (Radcliffe 1987:808). The possibility that exorphins are involved has been noted (Bell 1987:715), and Brostoff and Gamlin conclude (1989:230):

> … the results so far suggest that they might influence our mood. There is certainly no question of anyone getting "high" on a glass of milk or a slice of bread – the amounts involved are too small for that – but these foods might induce a sense of comfort and wellbeing, as food-intolerant patients often say they do. There are also other hormone-like peptides in partial digests of food, which might have other effects on the body.

There is no possibility that craving these foods has anything to do with the popular notion of the body telling the brain what it needs for nutritional purposes. These foods were not significant in the human diet before agriculture, and large quantities of them cannot be necessary for nutrition. In fact, the standard way to treat food intolerance is to remove the offending items from the patient's diet.

#####A suggested interpretation of exorphin research

But what are the effects of these foods on normal people? Though exorphins cannot have a naturally selected physiological function in humans, this does not mean that they have _no_ effect. Food intolerance research suggests that cereals and milk, in normal dietary quantities, are capable of affecting behaviour in many people. And if severe behavioural effects in schizophrenics and coeliacs can be caused by higher than normal absorption of peptides, then more subtle effects, which may not even be regarded as abnormal, could be produced in people generally.

The evidence presented so far suggests the following interpretation.
The ingestion of cereals and milk, in normal modern dietary amounts by normal humans, activates reward centres in the brain. Foods that were common in the diet before agriculture (fruits and so on) do not have this pharmacological property. The effects of exorphins are qualitatively the same as those produced by other opioid and / or dopaminergic drugs, that is, reward, motivation, reduction of anxiety, a sense of wellbeing, and perhaps even addiction. Though the effects of a typical meal are quantitatively less than those of doses of those drugs, most modern humans experience them several times a day, every day of their adult lives.

#####Hypothesis: exorphins and the origin of agriculture and civilisation

When this scenario of human dietary practices is viewed in the light of the problem of the origin of agriculture described earlier, it suggests an hypothesis that combines the results of these lines of enquiry.

Exorphin researchers, perhaps lacking a long-term historical perspective, have generally not investigated the possibility that these foods really are drug-like, and have instead searched without success for exorphin's natural function. The adoption of cereal agriculture and the subsequent rise of civilisation have not been satisfactorily explained, because the behavioural changes underlying them have no obvious adaptive basis.

These unsolved and until-now unrelated problems may in fact solve each other. The answer, we suggest, is this: cereals and dairy foods are not natural human foods, but rather are preferred because they contain exorphins. This chemical reward was the incentive for the adoption of cereal agriculture in the Neolithic. Regular self-administration of these substances facilitated the behavioural changes that led to the subsequent appearance of civilisation.

This is the sequence of events that we envisage.

Climatic change at the end of the last glacial period led to an increase in the size and concentration of patches of wild cereals in certain areas (Wright 1977). The large quantities of cereals newly available provided an incentive to try to make a meal of them. People who succeeded in eating sizeable amounts of cereal seeds discovered the rewarding properties of the exorphins contained in them. Processing methods such as grinding and cooking were developed to make cereals more edible. The more palatable they could be made, the more they were consumed, and the more important the exorphin reward became for more people.

At first, patches of wild cereals were protected and harvested. Later, land was cleared and seeds were planted and tended, to increase quantity and reliability of supply. Exorphins attracted people to settle around cereal patches, abandoning their nomadic lifestyle, and allowed them to display tolerance instead of aggression as population densities rose in these new conditions.

Though it was, we suggest, the presence of exorphins that caused cereals (and not an alternative already prevalent in the diet) to be the major early cultigens, this does not mean that cereals are "just drugs". They have been staples for thousands of years, and clearly have nutritional value. However, treating cereals as "just food" leads to difficulties in explaining why anyone bothered to cultivate them. The fact that overall health declined when they were incorporated into the diet suggests that their rapid, almost total replacement of other foods was due more to chemical reward than to nutritional reasons.

It is noteworthy that the extent to which early groups became civilised correlates with the type of agriculture they practised. That is, major civilisations (in south-west Asia, Europe, India, and east and parts of South-East Asia; central and parts of north and south America; Egypt, Ethiopia and parts of tropical and west Africa) stemmed from groups which practised cereal, particularly wheat, agriculture (Bender 1975:12, Adams 1987:201, Thatcher 1987:212). (The rarer nomadic civilisations were based on dairy farming.)

Groups which practised vegeculture (of fruits, tubers etc.), or no agriculture (in tropical and south Africa, north and central Asia, Australia, New Guinea and the Pacific, and much of north and south America) did not become civilised to the same extent.

Thus major civilisations have in common that their populations were frequent ingesters of exorphins. We propose that large, hierarchical states were a natural consequence among such populations. Civilisation arose because reliable, on-demand availability of dietary opioids to individuals changed their behaviour, reducing aggression, and allowed them to become tolerant of sedentary life in crowded groups, to perform regular work, and to be more easily subjugated by rulers. Two socioeconomic classes emerged where before there had been only one (Johnson & Earle 1987:270), thus establishing a pattern which has been prevalent since that time.

#### Discussion

#####The natural diet and genetic change

Some nutritionists deny the notion of a pre-agricultural natural human diet on the basis that humans are omnivorous, or have adapted to agricultural foods (e.g. Garn & Leonard 1989; for the contrary view see for example Eaton & Konner 1985). An omnivore, however, is simply an animal that eats both meat and plants: it can still be quite specialised in its preferences (chimpanzees are an appropriate example). A degree of omnivory in early humans might have preadapted them to some of the nutrients contained in cereals, but not to exorphins, which are unique to cereals.

The differential rates of lactase deficiency, coeliac disease and favism (the inability to metabolise fava beans) among modern racial groups are usually explained as the result of varying genetic adaptation to post-agricultural diets (Simopoulos 1990:27-9), and this could be thought of as implying some adaptation to exorphins as well. We argue that little or no such adaptation has occurred, for two reasons: first, allergy research indicates that these foods still cause abnormal reactions in many people, and that susceptibility is variable within as well as between populations, indicating that differential adaptation is not the only factor involved. Second, the function of the adaptations mentioned is to enable humans to digest those foods, and if they are adaptations, they arose because they conferred a survival advantage. But would susceptibility to the rewarding effects of exorphins lead to lower, or higher, reproductive success? One would expect in general that an animal with a supply of drugs would behave less adaptively and so lower its chances of survival. But our model shows how the widespread exorphin ingestion in humans has led to increased population. And once civilisation was the norm, non-susceptibility to exorphins would have meant not fitting in with society. Thus, though there may be adaptation to the nutritional content of cereals, there will be little or none to exorphins. In any case, while contemporary humans may enjoy the benefits of some adaptation to agricultural diets, those who actually made the change ten thousand years ago did not.

#####Other "non-nutritional" origins of agriculture models

We are not the first to suggest a non-nutritional motive for early agriculture. Hayden (1990) argued that early cultigens and trade items had more prestige value than utility, and suggested that agriculture began because the powerful used its products for competitive feasting and accrual of wealth. Braidwood et al. (1953) and later Katz and Voigt (1986) suggested that the incentive for cereal cultivation was the production of alcoholic beer:

> Under what conditions would the consumption of a wild plant resource be sufficiently important to lead to a change in behaviour (experiments with cultivation) in order to ensure an adequate supply of this resource? If wild cereals were in fact a minor part of the diet, any argument based on caloric need is weakened. It is our contention that the desire for alcohol would constitute a perceived psychological and social need that might easily prompt changes in subsistence behaviour (Katz & Voigt 1986:33).

This view is clearly compatible with ours. However there may be problems with an alcohol hypothesis: beer may have appeared after bread and other cereal products, and been consumed less widely or less frequently (Braidwood et al. 1953). Unlike alcohol, exorphins are present in all these products. This makes the case for chemical reward as the motive for agriculture much stronger. Opium poppies, too, were an early cultigen (Zohari 1986). Exorphin, alcohol, and opium are primarily rewarding (as opposed to the typically hallucinogenic drugs used by some hunter-gatherers) and it is the artificial reward which is necessary, we claim, for civilisation. Perhaps all three were instrumental in causing civilised behaviour to emerge.

Cereals have important qualities that differentiate them from most other drugs. They are a food source as well as a drug, and can be stored and transported easily. They are ingested in frequent small doses (not occasional large ones), and do not impede work performance in most people. A desire for the drug, even cravings or withdrawal, can be confused with hunger. These features make cereals the ideal facilitator of civilisation (and may also have contributed to the long delay in recognising their pharmacological properties).

#####Compatibility, limitations, more data needed

Our hypothesis is not a refutation of existing accounts of the origins of agriculture, but rather fits alongside them, explaining why cereal agriculture was adopted despite its apparent disadvantages and how it led to civilisation.

Gaps in our knowledge of exorphins limit the generality and strength of our claims. We do not know whether rice, millet and sorghum, nor grass species which were harvested by African and Australian hunter-gatherers, contain exorphins. We need to be sure that preagricultural staples do not contain exorphins in amounts similar to those in cereals. We do not know whether domestication has affected exorphin content or-potency. A test of our hypothesis by correlation of diet and degree of civilisation in different populations will require quantitative knowledge of the behavioural effects of all these foods.

We do not comment on the origin of noncereal agriculture, nor why some groups used a combination of foraging and farming, reverted from farming to foraging, or did not farm at all. Cereal agriculture and civilisation have, during the past ten thousand years, become virtually universal. The question, then, is not why they happened here and not there, but why they took longer to become established in some places than in others. At all times and places, chemical reward and the influence of civilisations already using cereals weighed in favour of adopting this lifestyle, the disadvantages of agriculture weighed against it, and factors such as climate, geography, soil quality, and availability of cultigens influenced the outcome. There is a recent trend to multi-causal models of the origins of agriculture (e.g. Redding 1988, Henry 1989), and exorphins can be thought of as simply another factor in the list. Analysis of the relative importance of all the factors involved, at all times and places, is beyond the scope of this paper.

#### Conclusion

> "An animal is a survival machine for the genes that built it. We too are animals, and we too are survival machines for our genes. That is the theory. In practice it makes a lot of sense when we look at wild animals…. It is very different when we look at ourselves. We appear to be a serious exception to the Darwinian law…. It obviously just isn't true that most of us spend our time working energetically for the preservation of our genes" (Dawkins 1989:138).

Many ethologists have acknowledged difficulties in explaining civilised human behaviour on evolutionary grounds, in some cases suggesting that modern humans do not always behave adaptively. Yet since agriculture began, the human population has risen by a factor of 1000: Irons (1990) notes that "population growth is not the expected effect of maladaptive behaviour".

We have reviewed evidence from several areas of research which shows that cereals and dairy foods have drug-like properties, and shown how these properties may have been the incentive for the initial adoption of agriculture. We suggested further that constant exorphin intake facilitated the behavioural changes and subsequent population growth of civilisation, by increasing people's tolerance of (a) living in crowded sedentary conditions, (b) devoting effort to the benefit of non-kin, and (c) playing a subservient role in a vast hierarchical social structure.

Cereals are still staples, and methods of artificial reward have diversified since that time, including today a wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological cultural artifacts whose function, ethologically speaking, is to provide reward without adaptive benefit. It seems reasonable then to suggest that civilisation not only arose out of self-administration of artificial reward, but is maintained in this way among contemporary humans. Hence a step towards resolution of the problem of explaining civilised human behaviour may be to incorporate into ethological models this widespread distortion of behaviour by artificial reward.

...the Sensei of Natural Farming  
by Jim Bones

_"The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings."_[^1]  
Masanobu Fukuoka

In October of 1994, I traveled to Japan with a team working on a book about the leading methods of sustainable agriculture found around the world. Members included project director Howard Shapiro; writer Catherine Yronwode; myself as photographer; publisher Anthony Rodale; and poet Naomi Otsubo Ash, our guide and translator from Tokyo.

We arrived in Osaka with the unsettled weather that precedes a typhoon. Next morning, under thick clouds we flew over the inland Sea to Iyo City on the Island of Shikoku. We traveled by trolley and train through densely populated neighborhoods where dazzling signs advertised many expensive things. Fat marbled Kobe beef was the most astonishing at $80 a pound. Valuable lots in town lay closely planted with vegetables, rice and flowers. In more suburban areas railside gardens grew larger and more varied in fruit and seed.

We arrived after noon near the sea coast and checked into an old hotel. After a brief rest and tea we prepared to meet the venerable Masanobu Fukuoka. He was born in 1913, of a family that has farmed the region for over 1400 years. Educated as a microbiologist, he is now a Mahayana Buddhist who practices simple agriculture as a spiritual path. He is the father and master teacher, the Sensei of the art of Natural Farming.

A taxi took us to his home at the edge of town where the rice fields and hillside orchards began. We were greeted at the door by Mrs. Fukuoka and politely invited inside. Mr. Fukuoka soon hobbled in on stiff legs bent with age. He was wiry and alert, and wore a loose blue farmer's pants and shirt. With his simple clothes, and wispy hair and beard, he reminded me of white clouds in a midday sky.

We each bowed, and settled onto the floor around a chabudai, a low table in the middle of a simply appointed room. Shoji rice paper doors slid shut from outside, and we were surrounded by an awkward silence.

Mr. Fukuoka looked at each of us, then asked through Naomi, "Why are you here?"

Howard replied, "We have come for answers to a list of questions about Natural Farming for a book on global sustainable agriculture."

"Questions, what questions?" Mr. Fukuoka inquired.

Howard showed him a list of standard questions prepared for those to be interviewed for the book. They were mostly technical details related to such things as design, soil, tilling, mulch, fertilizers, pest and weed control--gardening and farming methods broken down for ease of review.

Mr. Fukuoka took the questions, paged through them, and frowned. "No thank you very much!",  he said sternly. "Do you understand anything about Natural Farming?"

"Yes," said Howard, "but we want to hear it directly from you and share your knowledge and experience with the world."

"No," Mr. Fukuoka replied brusquely, "I do not think you really understand. If you wish, take my books, study them tonight, and if you still want to learn about Natural Farming, come back tomorrow morning."

We were bewildered, for we had arrived believing all arrangements had been made weeks before, and that Mr. Fukuoka would answer the questions. Obviously it was not going to happen that day. We returned to town, wandered around the market place, then went to our hotel in confusion. Mr. Fukuoka had sent us away with many things to read, including _The Natural Way of Farming_, _The Road Back to Nature_, and _The One-Straw Revolution_.

Reading through the evening, I learned about the profound vision of Nature revealed to him at age twenty five that led to his holistic philosophy. He recalled how in the depths of doubt and dark depression, a night heron's cry at dawn awoke him to Nature's perfection. He then described experimenting for scores of seasons with farming methods that imitate the natural cycles of birth and decay. Most intriguing of all was his idea of seed balls for promoting plant growth under difficult conditions. He lamented not training more students and expressed concern that simple ways of farming might be suppressed or lost just when the world most needs them.

In the morning, warm heavy air forecast the gathering storm as we hurried along to meet Mr. Fukuoka. He was somewhat more willing to talk when we arrived and wanted to know, "Have you read the books?"

We affirmed so, as much as possible.

"Did you understand?" he asked.

"Yes," said Howard, "but we would like to go over the list of questions just to be sure."

"Shaking his head Mr. Fukuoka said, "If you are still interested in learning about Natural Farming, go with my daughter and her helpers to the citrus orchards, then come back this afternoon."

Naomi, Cat and Anthony rode silently with his daughter, while Howard and I squeezed into a utility truck with a young man who spoke fluent English. He sped up a steep road that turned into a trail through dense forests of mandarin oranges. We soon crested the ridge and stopped in the mist surrounded by trees heavy with green fruit.

The hired orchard workers walked in all directions casually scattering seed. They tossed them under and between the trees, into open spaces and off down the hillsides below. We saw dried radish stalks, clover and green grasses everywhere, even under ridgeline cedars and among the oaks, maples, pines, and acacias.

It took only fifteen minutes to seed several acres. Then we boarded the trucks and rolled into a valley filled with fruit trees, horse chestnuts and huge bamboo. Again workers broadcast seed, and I asked if I could take pictures. One man agreed so I moved in for a shot of his hands. I was startled to see dozens of kinds of seeds, many clothed in the vivid chemical colors of biocides. "How could this be on a natural farm?" I quietly asked myself.

Cold rain came in earnest and we started back. In route I asked about the treated seeds. The worker said the younger family members consider it too risky to practice strict Natural Farming. It is really hard to find people who understand Mr. Fukuoka's philosophy and recognize orchard plants easily. It seems modern farmers no longer work closely with soil, so each day fewer people know how to grow healthy food.

After lunch, we returned by taxi and hurried onto the portal to remove our wet coats and shoes. The door opened and we were let in, then like a whirlwind he gave us a lecture on "Not Doing".

Energetically he said, "Most farmers begin by asking, what if I do this or what if I do that, but only dissipate themselves that way. My approach just the opposite, seek the pleasant, natural way of farming. In order to make the work easier, not harder, I ask, how about not doing this or how about not doing that? By actual practice I finally reached conclusion there is no need to plow, no need to apply artificial fertilizer, no need to use pesticides at all. Most of the work of farming is created by tampering with Nature which causes negative side effects. Very few agricultural practices are even necessary, just scattering seed, spreading straw on the soil and harvesting."

Concerning soil and plant systems, he stated, "The secret of growing grain is as simple as the symbiosis of rice, barley or wheat, and clover." In October he broadcasts clover and barley over the ripening heads of rice. A few weeks later harvesters actually trample the seedlings, but they recover quickly. The gathered rice is dried for three days, thrashed, and the uncut straw scattered randomly back on the field. If ducks or chickens are not free to roam then occasionally he adds a little manure as well.

Before the New Year arrives he coats rice seeds with clay and broadcasts them over green barley, then waits for spring to come. By harvest in May the winter crop is ripe, white clover covers the field, and rice shoots are sprouting from clay pellets. Barley is harvested, dried and thrashed, and the uncut straw mulch is again returned to the field. He then floods for five or six days, just to weaken the clover while the young rice shoots break through. In June and July his field goes dry though his neighbors keep theirs under water. In August he irrigates every week or ten days. "That's about all there is until harvest," he said, "And the cycles begin again."

There was a lull in the discourse so Howard brought up the questions.

"No," Mr. Fukuoka shook his head, "Go to my old hillside orchard. See for yourself. If you are still interested come back tomorrow morning."

Just past the rice fields we found a new asphalt road that ended near the entrance to a forest on round green hills. From there a broken cement lane climbed sharply, then ended abruptly. Only a footpath continued on through deep old woods.

Another way circled back toward a clearing with work sheds and a forty foot high, wide open classroom that spiraled toward an overcast sky. Dark weathered straw covered the platform floor where, placed carefully to one side, lay several clay-coated wooden rollers.

Left in disorder were carved beams, a wooden mill for cleaning seeds, a steel cement mixer, handmade shovels, sickles, rakes and hoes. Everything was covered with dirt and leaves, as though completely forgotten. Feeling the emptiness I thought, where are his students, the future teachers, the ones who once used these rusty tools? When he finally departs, will anyone notice, and save his treasured orchards and farm? Except for the wind, like a voice in my head, all else fell utterly silent.

Chilled, I walked north on a path that tunneled into new growth, strange at first to my western eyes. Then I began to recognize old friends like mulberry, sumac, acacia and fig. I found myself in a small meadow grown wild, and to the untrained eye, abandoned. Iyo gleamed below, new and pulsating, while above, the early autumn orchard possessed a timeless feeling. The wind rose and the light died as a frustrating rain forced us back to town for another anxious night of waiting.

We all went to Mr. Fukuoka's hilltop orchard at first light, although the day was ominous, still and cloudy. I clattered around with my cameras and tripod as the others searched about. I had photographed the pagoda and rollers, and had just moved on to the seed mill, when Howard said simply, "Have a look at this".

Lifting the wet cover from the cement mixer, he reached in and pulled out incredible jewels, just like the ones in the books. Between his fingers were three brown clay balls, half an inch in diameter, each bursting with germinating seeds. The typhoon rains had brought them to life in spite of a prolonged drought.

Excited, we fanned out along the upper path announcing plants we recognized. I knew in my heart we had found no ordinary orchard for it was wild, yet edible, spiritual and nurturing in a way only unbound Nature can be. Around us grew peach, plum, maple, citrus, pine, acacia, melon vines and scores of plants we could not identify. The ground was littered with twigs, straw, clover and grasses, countless emerald leaves that wove a deep tapestry. And there was no bare earth at all!

Cat called out ginko, persimmon, hydrangea, and oak, then asked, "Is this a dawn redwood?" Howard found a cypress copse patiently trimmed for poles, with trees growing straight and tall. Naomi wandered blissfully throughout, exploring the reassuring forest, while I was stilled by the hollow music of silver bamboo gently clicking. Anthony strolled off alone looking for solitude and more open views of the fish pond in the valley below.

As our appointment neared we walked quickly back through neat paddy fields, some with green unharvested rice, others with pale seeded straw fresh cut and hung to dry. Only later would we understand that on the way we had passed Masanobu Fukuoka's natural field of maturing grain.

Mr. Fukuoka received us inside, then inquired, what had we found? He listened as we recited our morning highlights, then asked us one by one about our religious or spiritual background. Attentive to each reply, he sat quietly studying our faces, gauging I think, how much he could share. "Ignorance, hatred and greed are killing Nature," he said. "Down, down, everything goes. As we kill Nature, we are killing ourselves, and God incarnate as the world as well."[^2]

"The world is digging itself into a bottomless pit with modern agriculture," he admonished. "The simple hearth of the small farm is the true center of our universe. Scientific thought is leading you away from a healthy life. Even the practice of conventional organic agriculture is a dangerous digression. It cannot be sustained if you have to rob one part of the earth to feed another."

Mr. Fukuoka described his oriental view of evolution, from before the beginning of particle birth to the very present. As the material universe expands, he explained, all Life follows the same harmonious patterns of inwardly spiraling energy toward the Nothingness, called "Mu".

He told how Darwin's linear vision was clouded and incomplete, due to western "deconstructionist" thoughts. Blind to a total reality of Nature, Darwin saw figure and ground reversed and so found only struggle and competition, where unity of function exists. The Great Way, Sensei explained, has no pests, no disease. Only faults when seen in parts.

He told us the evolutionary process itself is not just singular and branching like a tree, but cyclic, more like a multitude of volcanic islands emerging and subsiding from the same sea floor. All kinds of creatures have grown simultaneously, from universal progenitors, according to the rise and fall of their individual genes. Yet by common origin each shares traits that prove the overall Oneness of Being.

The monera, he said, the bacteria and algae, the single-celled creatures so simple in structure, yet no less advanced hold a common bond with the rest of us, as co-descendants from the very beginning. Countless parallel punctuated evolutions, webbed and interconnected, derived the greatest diversity of forms from Ichiban, the original ones, that have always lived within, without, and beside us. When new kinds of food appear, new life forms in turn develop to eat them, and eventually everything becomes food for the Great One, in a perfect, self-balancing way.

Suddenly he left the room, then reappeared with a heavy polished stone. Rippling through it were orange and black bands of oxidized sediment and fossil bacteria, three and a half billion years old. He leaned slightly forward and without a word placed the ancestors in the palms of my hands! "Come back in two hours," he nodded, and dismissed us.

We returned a little early and sat on the porch to rest, but the door flew open and Mr. Fukuoka immediately asked us in. He left the room two or three times to gather books and art supplies. Finally he nodded, spread rice paper on the floor, and with brush and ink, sat ready to calligraph his story.

He began his long discourse simply: "What I want to tell you is that it is not human beings who create and grow plants. I want to talk about the roots of things in the world we cannot express with words, the world we cannot usually see. When we sow seed, we think we will grow plants. But actually plants grow without our knowledge or care. When we accumulate knowledge, we get lost. Accumulation of knowledge brings about our own ruin. I deny knowledge. God creates and grows plants. So, my foreign friends call me, "A Man Doing Nothing." These ideas of mine about Nature came to me when I was twenty five years old. People think that I must have gotten this idea through my fifty years of agricultural study. No! But it is impossible for me to describe the moment that suddenly changed my ideas."

"On this planet we do not have something we can call Nature any more. We have lost it. We do not have Nature we can go back to. What we must do is search for Nature. But human knowledge cannot do it. We can only ask Nature. So we, and especially seed companies in the world, should collect all kinds of seeds on the planet and offer them to God, Nature, and pray. This kind of attitude toward Nature is necessary. Of course, even if we pray, God will not say anything. We may not be inspired, either. But the plants which start growing are God's answer. Nature will teach you.

"Cultivating land is not good. It removes the green cover and exposes the bacteria to sunshine. Just as we need clothes to protect our skin from sunshine, our planet needs green. I have used my farm for fifty consecutive years. There is no need to let it take a rest because I have never cultivated it. If you just sow clay seed balls with one hundred kinds of seeds, do not worry about water. Where there is green, water comes. Do not think I do this, for only God has created perfect things."

He completed a drawing, then as the silence grew long, we asked how he got the idea of seed balls. He replied, "You know that daikon radish seeds are in hard shells, well, I noticed that when they drop on the ground, they decay as they start to sprout. So I realized if they need a shell like that, then clay can be the shell for a ball with many seeds inside."

Amazed, I said, "So they do not have to sprout on the surface, they have the protection of the clay shell to begin with, and soil and moisture. Its a small earth, a miniature earth, how beautiful, and so simple." He regarded us carefully then said, "Many people are interested in seed balls, but they do not act. I love best to give children boxes of seeds as gifts because they scatter them so innocently."

"Seed balls need at least one hundred kinds of seeds," he then asserted. "One seed eventually makes ten thousand seeds. If you sow seed balls, and wait three years, you will understand what Nature is. It works much better than reading books about Natural Farming. Seed balls are a small universe in themselves. I have written six books, but I was unable to express what Nature is in words. So I decided to manifest Nature in form. A seed ball is a one centimeter model of a Natural Farm, with trees, fruits, vegetables and grains. I do not say my one hundred kinds of seeds are the best. It is just an entrance to Natural Farming."

"God's love grows plants. Nature grows crops. Birds sow seeds. In three years, even the soil starts changing spontaneously. There are no ideas like big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, in Nature. No idea like 'the struggle for existence'. There are bugs and diseases, but they do not cause problems. Many kinds of bugs co-exist in natural harmony. We cannot know why plants grow. I dare say, God's love. For example, the soil on my mountain is the same as that in the deserts and was not green fifty years ago. But now, even though I have not changed the soil, plants grow there."

"In the beginning, man-made deserts were also green," he cautioned, "And the most important thing is to stop the advancement of arid lands around the world today." He said we can do this quickly by spreading seeds, hundreds of different kinds suitable to each locality, by the ton, from airplanes. His method involves making half inch balls like those we had found, containing hundreds of mixed seeds, microbes and humus, all rolled inside protective clay coatings. Clay shells defend the seeds from drought, insects, rodents and birds that would otherwise eat them before they sprout. Timely rains then release the seeds and no matter where they land something appropriate inside will grow. Once established, the resulting plants naturally reseed themselves with the help of gravity, wind, water, insects and larger animals."

"At first I picked five or six kinds of acacia," he added, "then transplanted them. But transplanting was a big mistake, I do not do it any more. You can check that trees planted by birds are really straight, grow two meters per year. Check how old by branching. Roots like this," he drew out the motion, "Upper parts of tree are the same. If I go to desert now I say, 'I am a foolish old man,' and proceed that way."

"Big trees, between forty and one hundred meters high, and short trees, are also needed," he explained. "If trees grow tall enough, to about one hundred meters, that indicates a one-hundred per cent return of Nature in that area. Anyway we need trees of various heights. But I want to use three thousand kinds of seeds in Africa, because one hundred kinds are not enough. Unfortunately seeds are hard to get. It is easy to make seed balls, but we have to be careful in choosing seeds, especially for Africa. It all depends on the area, type of country, how quickly the desert is spreading and so on. Animals need to eat too, so spread seed balls over as large an area as possible. Otherwise, even as seeds sprout, they will be eaten."

I asked him exactly what clay to use for making the seed balls. "Red clay," he answered confidently, "like for tiles, red bricks, like the soil deep down. Red clays, not white porcelain clays. Point is, clay is shell, seeds should be protected like that. you must hide seeds so animals cannot see them. Diameter of seed balls should vary according to size of the seeds. A layer of soil humus and clay about two and one half times the collective diameter of the mixed seeds should cover the seed clusters. For aerial seed spreading, hardened clay covers all. Bigger seeds means bigger seed balls. Single seed crops like rice may have only one grain in each clay pellet. Huge seeds like coconuts just need to be covered."

"A clay ball has all the fertilizers needed in it, but they are 'sleeping'. Clay is sleeping soil. But water can wake it. People think that red clay has no value. But all fertilizers are in red clay. For example, nitrogen, calcium, many minerals are in red clay, To wake clay up we need 'cutting' with acids from rain and ground water, and acids from plant roots and organisms living around them."

"Many atoms are in seed balls. But they are sleeping, because they have not dissolved. Since they have not dissolved, plants cannot absorb them. Clay catches these components. To the components, red clay is like a blanket. We have to take the blanket off. To do that we need to 'cut with scissors'. The 'scissors' are green growing plants such as acacias and clovers and the carbonic acids produced around their roots. In seed balls, there is everything. You will see it if you check the elementary clay particles."

"Red clay was the first soil when the Earth was made. People think that plants, fertilizers and soil are different. People think that lifeless things and bacteria are different. But all were in clay from the beginning. That is why I say, there is no need for chemical fertilizer. If you look at the elementary particles in clay you will understand. Seed balls have everything. That is the way I think about seed balls. Plants, animals, soil and everything are connected, brothers and sisters, relatives. But human beings are short-sighted and we cannot see that all are connected by love."

"If we do nothing, mountains will be able to get their green cover back. Forty years ago, there were five or six people living here. At that time, my mountain could not easily recover its green. So I did not let people go to my mountain for a while. And trees started growing. Especially, these last four or five years, because I have not been able to go to my mountain very often. I am too old. Trees are growing bigger and bigger. Also more birds have come and they carry more seeds from the trees, and more trees are growing from the seed sowed by birds. These trees have a more natural shape and grow faster. Every year they bear fruit."

"Most of the trees on my mountain are six or seven years old. The acacias are ten years old. I forgot when, but a man who planted trees in the Himalayas for sixteen years, and a man who planted trees in Bangladesh for four years came to me and learned how to make seed balls. Also there was an American woman and a Japanese priest. They came because they realized that they could not keep up with the speed of desertification by planting trees. They cut eight Japanese cypress on my mountain and made a place to stay. Japanese cypress are very expensive, so usually people do not use them to make a temporary lodge. But we did it to let people know that if you sow seed balls, it is easy to build houses made from the trees from your own mountains. You can plant only three hundred trees a day, but you can sow seed balls one hundred times faster. The cost is one-one/hundredth that of planting trees. Seed balls are the only way to catch up with the speed of desertification on our planet."

"Food, clothing and shelter are very easy. If you sow seed balls for just one hour in your life, you can have enough wood to build a few houses in your lifetime. You can make clothes from your plants. You can get food. One day of sowing for trees, one day for vegetables and fruit, one day for grains. If you sow seed balls of rice and barley in an area of one thousand square meters, you can get six hundred kilograms of each grain, which is enough for one family of five people for one year. If you work three or four days a year, you can have a good life."

"The power of Nature is great, because the natural structure is solid, three dimensional, not horizontal or two dimensional. Some of my mountain peach trees have kiwis climbing on them, and above the kiwi vines, there is a kind of melon. So three kinds of fruit exist together at different heights. I get one or two kilograms of fruit from one square meter of ground. This is a good sustainable yield. Natural production is greater than man-made production, because the structure is solid."

"On my mountain there is a place where I sowed seed balls twenty years ago and now it is like a jungle. But there are fruit trees and there are kiwis. Now I know that even in a place like a jungle, kiwis can grow. Humans are just destroying the power of Nature. We have only one-fourth of the growing power of Nature left. We are not increasing fertility or production, but rather trying to prevent production from failing by using fertilizers."

"We are only looking from the outside at Nature, not from the inside. There are a limitless number of points in time and space. For example, there is one point here, another there. You go right and left to accumulate knowledge." He filled a page with symbols and asked, "So, Naomi, where are you in this picture?" Deeply reflective, she replied that she was not there, and he smiled with approval.

He painted a mountain like Fujiyama, covered by streams and trees, with people toiling on the slopes. Then he asked the rest of us, "Where are you on this Mountain of Nature?" He watched us closely as we stumbled through our answers, then laughed, "No! You should be sleeping at the foot of the Mountain. Do nothing. Close your eyes and shut out the external world. This is the way to look at Nature, from inside."

"Sow seed balls with a child-like mind whenever, wherever, without judging the first year. During the second year birds or bugs will carry the seeds from the plants and sow them naturally for you. So in the third year you will get a natural design. Children sometimes sow seeds in unexpected places, and that brings us to a big discovery that we never even considered. Even if ninety-nine per cent fail, and only one percent succeed, that will take us to new possibilities. If you use human wisdom, you will only achieve the result you expect."

"I will give you an example, showing how Nature can teach us. After giving a lecture in California one summer I was asked by some young men to teach them how to survive on Natural Farming. They took me to their plain. I was surprised to see it. It was almost desert. I told them that the land was too bad and that I could not help them. But I looked around and saw a spring. I stayed there one night and the next morning, I went to the spring to wash my face. There was a mouse burrow next to the spring, and when people washed themselves, water spilled down the hole. I looked into the hole and found green plants. I realized that the soil there was not dead, the seeds were just sleeping through the heat of the summer, and if we watered them they must sprout."

"I awoke the young men and started sowing vegetable seeds on the plain and watered the land. In a few days foxtail grass, a weed, sprouted. But in a week, it had all died because of the summer heat, and after that the vegetables also sprouted.  So Nature, the mouse burrow, taught me that this plain was turning into desert because only a few weeds like foxtail were covering it. Nature also taught us the way to kill those weeds and turn the desert into a vegetable garden. Human beings have no way of learning except from Nature. Only God has been creating and we have only transformed what God has created. What God creates is Truth, Goodness and Beauty."

"In Bangladesh, India, Africa, Europe, America, many, many locations, I have demonstrated it is possible to stop the advance of man-made deserts with Natural Farming, and bring back green plants for food and shelter. But some governments interfered, and in places called the people seditious when they became well fed and independent. Although able in one year to re-grow small edible forest, poor people were forced to return to chemically dependent agriculture. No thank you! In Somalia, you brought food with guns, but only those with guns got food, so you should only send seed in future."

"When I went to Somalia, I looked down on the land from an airplane People say that there is no water, but there is! I found a large, two hundred meter wide, river disappearing suddenly in the desert. Where did it go? Underground! If you dig two meters down, you will feel moisture. So if we sow plants whose roots reach two meters, they will get water and grow."

"Africa has only three per cent of its jungle left from eighty years ago. Since people in Africa, after European colonization, started growing only a few kinds of plants for export, like coffee, tea, corn and cotton, the desert has been spreading. This unbalanced agriculture contirbuted to desertification. The governments in Africa take seeds away from people so that they cannot be self-sufficient and have to start producing cash crops that only benefit the leaders."

"He held up a book and said, "Look at these pictures. People from the government here in Somalia, have been planting only a few kinds of trees such as eucalyptus, and have given them eighteen tons of water, eight times a day. But half of them have died. They wanted to know why. I told them not to water them. It prevented the roots from growing deep because the plants were satisfied with the surface water. I advised them to change the kinds of plants they were using. I suggested acacia, whose roots grow two meters within the week they sprout. And also sow vegetable seeds with acacias."

"Seed is sentient," he said. "Very small seed goes down into dirt. It only one who knows how to make plants, fruits. Begin with acacia. Acacia say, 'Water, no thank you,' sends root down one meter, two meter, bring up water. Then plant watermelon, sweet potato, daikon in shade. Protect with brush so camels and goats stay out of green belt and in time, with seed balls, all saved."

"At first, the government did not like this idea. But they allowed people to sow vegetable seeds, but only in gardens. Seeds! Seeds are the best gifts to Africa, in Somalia, I was told by the police not to give seeds to people. Otherwise, I would be arrested. But I did. Children were the first people who came to me to get seeds. When the children sowed them, they sprouted. When the young people saw that, they came and asked me to give them seeds. I, of course did it. They started sowing seeds in the desert. A young man who sowed one of my seeds, watched the seed for three days without sleeping until it sprouted. Watching one seed! Look," he showed us another picture, "You see, even orange trees grew one meter in two years. So it is easy to convert to fruit trees in Africa."

Changing directions, Cat asked, "What about over-population?" He thought for a moment then answered, "Population, the question sounds important. But it is totally wrong to try to solve all problems by controlling population. Animals do not do this. God has a plan. If God makes people, God makes food for them. There is food and dinosaurs appear. There is food and humans appear. We make deserts. If we make deserts green, we can all eat. How many human beings can be fed by Natural Farming? You have that question because you think human beings make human beings. But we do not even know why frogs or ants are born. When there is enough food for five million people, five million people will be born. God's plan is perfect. But, only when human beings stop destroying Nature, can we survive. Because of the degree of this destruction, we have put ourselves in a situation where we have to control population."

Cat persisted, asking for a comment on whether there would be a temporary food shortage until Natural Farming on a big scale could take off. Mr. Fukuoka shook his head, "No problem. If all Japanese were farmers, not impossible to do. With Natural Farming, in Japan five people can live on one thousand square meters of land. If people see this they cannot say all will get the same results. Not easy, but it can be done."[^3]

Cat went on to ask if he had planted a hydrangea with blue flowers in the orchard, to test the soil. He turned to Naomi for a moment, then looked up and explained, "Is very interesting, that flower changed color as soil changed. I planted it to check if soil acid or alkali, but realized that kind of scientific observation is not necessary, so now I just spread seeds and let Nature do the work."

"Very scientific. Natural Farming is described as science beyond science. Natural Farm techniques are based on cycles. If you see how the Natural Farm looks, you will understand. It is Nature, or God's design itself. Ideas and patterns by that fellow, Bill Mollison of Permaculture Design, if he practiced Natural Farming, waste no time, arrive at same thing. If you go home and make seed balls, it will be all right, even if you do not know everything. But if you expect results, you might fail. Just do it. Do not doubt!"

Raising his hand he said, "I know you feel you must ask a lot of questions, but if you just believe, I will show you a secret." He climbed stiffly to his feet, left the room and returned with two rice plants, one tall and spindly, the other short, robust and heavy-headed, both wrapped in newspaper, muddy roots and all. I asked if he had grown them himself.  "Yes, this one," he said, pointing to the vigorous plant. "The other is from a neighbor's field."  We moved closer for a better look, and I asked how many grains were on each head.

"How many do you think?" he answered, and Howard suggested maybe one hundred to one hundred and twenty five for normal high yield.

"About two hundred grains," he claimed. "Farmers plant one square meter with fifteen plants, count stalks, twenty each plant, thirty thousand grains. I put ten balls in same area, had thirty plants, each plant two hundred grains, best harvest scientifically, sixty thousand grains, also stronger plants. Theoretically, this is the ideal rice production. It is impossible to produce more than that, you see? Because on Natural Farm, plants can absorb one-hundred per cent of the energy from sunshine. No artificial fertilizer, so plants have power to absorb all available sunshine. That is limiting factor on how much plants can produce."

Cat wanted to know if he had developed it by selection or breeding. "First I tried breeding," he replied, "But realized bugs were doing same thing, so I just let them, and now look for new kinds. I always have new varieties of rice appearing in my field. Much of the brown rice you eat in America today came from my field. Yours is brother to mine. Years ago I gave a few grains to two men, but they only took it, bred it and now sell it, without reward to me or using the money for Natural Farming. I only asked one percent of profit be promised for protection of environment, any more must be used for educating about natural ways. But I gave seeds before a contract was signed. They went ahead without permission, I only hope they are using profit in good ways, but I have not heard."

"With breeding by bugs, scientific breeding is not necessary. Now I know human beings are fools. I found out that what I was doing was not necessary. I have studied for fifty years, I did not need to. When I was twenty five years old, I came to this conclusion. And after fifty years, I reached the same conclusion. We do not need to do anything. But people know it is very difficult to do nothing, when no Nature is left, and desertification is spreading. So, I made seed balls. Sowing seed balls is the necessary minimum that must be done."

I pestered him about when I should put out the seed balls, in fall, winter, or wait until spring. "No time, no place special," he answered patiently. "You have to decide, even if snow is falling, seeds do not sprout. That all there is to it. First roots sprout, different from ordinary idea."

Then he shifted deliberately to the need to reprint his books, most of which are difficult to find. Anthony, whose father produced the first English edition, wanted to know in how many other languages _The One-Straw Revolution_ had appeared. At least eleven we were told. "How many of those publishers got permission," he asked? "None, no one," Mr. Fukuoka shrugged. He could not ask the poor countries for money he said, and the rest just published for free. Next time, Mr. Fukuoka said, he would like to republish _The One-Straw Revolution_ himself, and then arrange for some kind of distribution.

With an air of finality he looked at each of us, then said, "You cannot compare my ways to those of anyone else by breaking them down. Do not try to mix ideas. You will only confuse people and fail. Give yourself to whatever you do one-hundred per cent or not at all, and do not doubt. Everything will be all right. Just spread seed balls and Nature will do the rest." As we left, Naomi politely told him we would get in touch about books soon, and that we hoped to see him again. He replied, "Take your time. Anyway, time does not exist."

Our last day in Japan dawned calm with thin clouds, so Howard and I ran to the old orchard for a final look. I worked along a narrow path to the top of the hill where Sensei's tiny mud and bamboo hut sat entwined in massive wisteria. Its simplicity was liberating, having only a roof, sliding panels for walls, and an open hearth in the middle. Pots, pans, utensils, hand tools and a futon lay on the floor. High on one wall of the dojo was a single drawing of Nature's Mountain, a distillation of all he had taught us the day before.

Not yet satisfied with the whole view, Howard knocked about inside for inspiration while I desperately searched the orchard for suitable parts to photograph. The edible vines, fruit trees and shrubs were obvious, as were the grains, but where were the abundant vegetable crops? Where were the progeny of the seed balls that replanted themselves year after year?

Howard stepped out and called, "We have to go or miss our flight. I'll give you a hand with the cameras." He started down, and in a panic I shouted, "I feel like its all around me, but I can't quite picture it." He reached for my pack and I asked, "By the way, what are these knee deep weeds, do you know?" As he leaned closer and I kneeled to the ground, thousands of intertwined daikons, sweet potatoes, cabbages, carrots, beans, kudzus, kiwis, and more, began to reveal themselves. "My God, this is it!" I exclaimed, "We are standing on an edible forest floor." Lush green and wet with dew, shining proof of the vision Sensei had, fifty years ago grew everywhere we looked. And for a moment we too were enfolded in the transcendent fruit of a lifetime devoted to bringing people and Nature together again.

"A Prodigious Discovery"
_Fasting: Nature’s Best Remedy_
by Albert Mosséri

~~

"In 1986, I made a prodigious discovery in the field of fasting that forced me to revise my Sheltonian method. This is how I was led to make this discovery:

A 37-year-old man came to fast under my supervision. He had taken 104 different tranquilizers for his nervous state during the past 14 years. As soon as a drug wasn't having any effect anymore, his doctor prescribed him another one, thus the incredible number of different tranquilizers he took. He wanted to cure himself without drugs of any sort, so he fasted for 29 days.

Then he became tense, incapable of relaxing or sleeping and unable to drink water despite an intense thirst and an acute kidney pain. I told him that he could not continue this way, even though he still had a lot to eliminate - his tongue was still very coated, his urine dark, his breath foul and he had pains in the kidneys despite all the water he had drunk.

He responded that he still had a lot of time and that he wanted to complete his detoxification... so i thought that the opprtunity had come, for the first time, to make him follow a detoxification diet...

Every time a faster breaks his fast, he only wants to leave and I can't monitor his tongue anymore... for all those that come for a cure, my greatest concern is to facilitate the reintroduction of food, in a manner that avoids all the problems... must ration the quantities each day, increasing them and change the types of food according to each case... I do all this while watching the various symptoms that will guide me in the process.

I rarely have this chance... I was fortunate to have such a determined man in my care.

Three days after breaking his fast, I entered his room to bring him a few small apples. He told me, "Mr. Mosseri, look at my tongue" ... it was charcoal black! It didn't take long to understand this surprise... I had already seen a few cases where the tongue turned black during a fast - but this man was eating again! Yet the color was not accidental... I had provoked it with this "detoxification diet". I had restarted his elimination, the profound elimination of a fast. I also realized that I could have done this much earlier - a week earlier, at the 20th day of the fast.. he thus lost about ten days, during which time his elimination was very weak ... his tongue stayed black for a few days... then it turned a mustard yellow for many weeks, before returning to a healthy rose color ... at the same time, hunger came back - a true hunger - and the kidney pains disappeared... I then fed him a normal diet. I wondered if this case was an exception, or if it could be imitated as many times as possible with other fasting patients... obviously, this half-fast had accelerated his elimination, but one case does not mean much ...I needed verification through numerous, varied cases ....

I started again in the same manner with two sisters that came after the man... the very day after they broke their fasts, their tongues were coated brown ... since then, 90% of my patients develop a colored tongue upon breaking the fast and commencing the half-fast and the other 10% develop it during a second cure ... this half-fast must, of course, be continued as long as the tongue is even a little colored... a black tongue shows that elimination has deepened, reaching into cellular level to root out decades-old drugs and toxins ... other questions came naturally in my mind: at what moment do we break the fast and go to the half-fast? What quantities of raw foods must be given to the patients?

Having observed it many times, I already knew that a day comes when a patient's weight ceases to drop... only now do I understand why! As for the food quantities, with a lot of trial and error, I arrived at the actual rations, more or less according to the height of the person ...

In the classical method, promoted by Shelton, the fast is pursued with water in bed... but when the fast is continued, though the body ceases losing weight, elimination becomes insignificant and time is lost ... when someone noted to Shelton that a faster was only losing 200g a day and that the elimination barely continued, he answered that it was 200g gained and that it was still better than nothing ... he did not see we could jump-start elimination instead of standing about, making no progress ... when the fast is pursued at this stagnant stage, weight hardly falls and elimination barely proceeds because the body does not have enough vitamins and enzymes for it ... the body has just enough to survive.

As we have seen earlier, the body's reserves are imbalanced ... there is always too much fat and toxins and too few essential elements, when they run out, we go to the next phase, the half-fast, and the tongue colors itself in 90% of cases ... for the other ones, it will color at a second fast ... I could not find out the reasons why...on the other hand, with the classic Sheltonian method, it is very rare that the tongue will color itself, even if the fast is pursued to 60-70 days ...

When the tongue colors itself (black, brown, mustard green, beige), the half-fast must be pursued until the color returns to a natural pink, that is, until the end of elimination. Then, the more concentrated foods can be introduced. The tongue becomes pink at the same time that spitting stops, the urine becomes clear, the breath becomes pleasant, and the headaches are gone. The half-fast can last for one week or many, according to the degree of toxemia.

With this new method, the fasting becomes easier, with fewer risks and problems and more efficient. The fast becomes mathematical, precise, scientific and without blind spots or surprises. This important discovery condemns the long fasts as a risky waste of time.

I called this second part of the fast that follows the water fast the half-fast ... but in reality, it's an elimination diet, since two pounds of food is eaten every day, half fruits, half vegetables ...but I preferred to call it the half-fast, to strike the imagination of the fasting person ...otherwise, he would be tempted to think that he's breaking the fast and that he can eat whatever food and in any quantities ...he has to stay with the impression that he's continuing elimination and that his cure also continues, although in another, less intense form than the complete fast.

#### the reasons for this method

Whenever we stop eating, elimination starts and is evidenced by a white tongue coated with mucus, a foul breath, a bad taste in the mouth, a loss of weight and other symptoms according to the individual. As the fast goes on, eliminaton slows down because it uses up the body's stock of vitamins and minerals. Depending on the individual, this stock of vitamins and other essential elements lasts approximately 7 to 20 days. At the end of this period, elimination slows down, as revealed in the following symptoms:

- weight loss slows to 1-2 pounds a week, stabilizing about every three days ... it was 1-2 pounds a day before... the loss of weight signifies a strong elimination of toxins and retained water, which are urinated ...when elimination weakens, we don't urinate much... this stabilization of the weight is the main signal to begin the
half-fast.
- thirst disappears and drinking water is difficult, before, elimination created the need to drink in order to dilute the poisons and expel them in the urine.
- the coating of the tongue is lighter in color and thickness, and the bad taste in the mouth lessens.
- other symptoms specific to each individual can also reveal a slowdown in elimination.
- Thus, when these symptoms of the slowing of elimination appear it must be relaunched, by breaking the fast and replenishing the body with nutrients in the form of raw, natural foods:
- 500 grams of raw fruits, spread through the afternoon, this quantity varying according to the person's height;
- 500 grams of raw vegetables and salad, in two sittings in the evening.

These amounts should not be increased, otherwise digestion will take the energy needed by elimination and bring it to a halt ...

The patient should drink a lot of water between midnight and noon, because that's when elimination is at its strongest... if the person is not able to drink at least one liter a day of plain water, then we flavor it with lemon juice ...

The fruits that I prefer to give are apples, because they act like a good broom in the intestines...

Sometimes, a water-rich fruit, like melon or Watermelon must be given ...

As soon as we switch to the half-fast, rekindling elimination, we must examine the tongue every morning before putting anything in the mouth ... it should not be washed! Within a few days, if not a few hours, it colors itself black, mustard, or brownish red ... the half-fast is pursued until the tongue is completely clear ... it becomes pink and all eliminative symptoms (thirst, bad taste in the mouth upon awakening, bad breath, spitting, etc.) disappear...

It does not matter if, in the meantime, hunger comes back or not, because this Instinct is usually defective amongst civilized people."
