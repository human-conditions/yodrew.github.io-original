Lacking a psychology, hygiene could not penetrate certain depths of human experience nor treat certain subjects. That changes now. From now on, hygiene is a complete system of health capable of perfectly addressing every illness people face. No longer need anyone bear the costs and failures of medicine and other systems essentially rooted in the doctrine of original sin and the practice of exorcism. 

#### pathology





Pathology is the study of disease, including its nature, causes, and symptoms. Pathology guides our conscious response to disease. Every school of health has a general theory of pathology. In fact, many systems are named for their pathologies because they are basically oriented toward disease: homeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy, allopathy (medicine). Allopathy's germ theory of disease leads doctors to gloss over causes and get right to symptomology and treatment. By contrast, a benevolent view of disease keeps a hygienist cool as a cucumber. Hygiene makes plenty of time to correct allopathy's imbalance with careful etiology (study of causes). This reveals the simplest and most effective responses.

In the 1930s, hygienist Dr. John Tilden, identified seven stages of all chronic disease. This provides hygiene with a general theory of pathology. Each stage describes what happens as our energy level gets lower and lower. Note that a sick person can move down the steps (become sicker), or up (become well). It is simple cause and effect. Hygiene proves in theory and repeatedly demonstrates in practice the reversibility of the trend.

The following summary of Tilden's analysis of disease comes from _The Health Seekers Yearbook_ by [Victoria Bidwell](http://getwellstaywell.com).

#### seven stages of disease

1. Enervation: Nerve Energy is so reduced or exhausted that all normal bodily functions are greatly impaired, especially the elimination of endogenous and exogenous poisons. Stage One thus begins the progressive and chronic process of “Toxemia Toleration” that continues through all of the following stages. The Toxic Sufferer does not feel his “normal self.” He feels either stimulated or depressed by the poisonous overload.
2. Toxemia: Nerve Energy is too low to eliminate metabolic wastes and ingested poisons. These toxic substances begin to saturate first the bloodstream and lymphatic fluids and then the cells themselves. The Toxic Sufferer feels inordinately tired, run-down, and “out of it.”
3. Irritation: Toxic build-up within the blood and lymph and tissues continues. The cells/tissues where build-up occurs are irritated by the toxic nature of the waste, resulting in a low-grade inflammation. The Toxic Sufferer can feel exhausted, queasy, irritable, itchy, even irrational and hostile. During these first 3 stages, if The Toxic Sufferer does consult a medical doctor about the reason for his low energy and irritability, the doctor tells him: “There is nothing wrong with you. These symptoms are ‘all in your head.’ You are perfectly healthy!”
4. Inflammation: The low-grade, chronic inflammation from Stage Three is leading to the death of cells. An area or organ where toxicants have amassed next becomes fully inflamed. The Toxic Sufferer experiences actual pain, along with pathological symptoms at this point. With the appearance of these symptoms, the medical doctor can finally give The Sufferer’s complaint a name. Traditionally, medical scientists have named many of the 20,000 distinctly different diseases after the site where the toxins have accumulated and precipitated their symptoms. Once the set of symptoms is conveniently named, the doctor can mechanically prescribe the “antidote” from his Physician’s Desk Reference or from his memorized medical/ pharmaceutical repertoire. Standard medical doctors thus commence drugging and treating at this stage.
5. Ulceration: Tissues are destroyed. The body ulcerates, forming an outlet for the poisonous build-up. The Toxic Sufferer experiences a multiplication and worsening of symptoms while the pain intensifies. Standard medical doctors typically continue drugging and often commence with surgery and other forms of more radical and questionable treatment at this stage.
6. Induration: Induration is the result of long-standing, chronic inflammation with bouts of acute inflammation interspersed. The chronic inflammation causes an impairment or sluggishness of circulation: and because some cells succumb, they are replaced with scar tissue. This is the way we lose good, normal-functioning cells — by chronic inflammation and death of cells. Toxins may or may not be encapsulated in a tumor, sac, wen, or polyp. The Toxic Sufferer endures even more physical pain, which is intensified by the emotional distress of realizing that he is only getting worse, regardless of his earnest, obedient, even heroic attempts to get well. Standard medical doctors continue with both drugging and surgery and all other kinds of modalities deemed appropriate, both conventional and experimental. (“Induration” means “hardening” or “scarring” of tissues.)
7. Fungation (cancer): Cellular integrity is destroyed through their disorganization and/or cancerous proliferation. Tissues, organs, and whole systems lose their ability to function normally. Biochemical and morphological changes from the depositing of Endogenous and Exogenous Toxins bring about degenerations and death at the cellular level. The Toxic Sufferer is “a pathological mess”: he is on his deathbed. Standard medical doctors declare at this stage: “There is no hope left. You have just so much longer to live. You need to make preparations accordingly.” Failure of vital organs eventually results in death.

##### comments

Tilden's analysis shows the close relationship between enervation and toxemia as the two most obvious causes of all illness. It explains hygiene's success in supporting the recovery of countless people whose cases allopathy pronounced hopeless.

But a flaw remained in hygiene's pathology, undermining its status and success. It did not acknowledge the importance of trauma and could not deal with it. Hygiene thus surrendered the  allopathic surgery its helplessness with trauma and the resulting dependency on allopathy's reckless embrace of. After all, how could enervation and toxemia begin in healthy mammals with strong, acute instincts? Only the overwhelming disaster of mass major trauma could do it. But this Cause Zero remained invisible to hygiene. This was due to trauma's dissociating, amnesiac effect; its distance in time from later chronic disease; the unconscious denial it induced; the deep pain and fear of approaching it; and the intense moralism of many hygienists, rooted in their great and rebellious efforts to be responsible for their health. 

Also, most hygienic physicians start as allopaths. Their fascination with and awe of surgery seems very hard to shake. It makes people seem powerful on nature's scale. It affirms the civilized fear of nature and the body. It reinforces the unconscious feeling of infantile helplessness following trauma.

In short, we seem caught in a strange dream, half-waking and prolonged. But rather than force ourselves awake with discipline, hygienic darkroom retreating allows us to fully sleep it out. Hygiene has always been a kind of physiological judo: calm, understanding, effective. Rather than wait for trauma to replay its disastrous drama in our lives, we can take hygiene's peaceful, reassured approach to resolving it once and for all.



















#### trauma

In the course of days alone in a darkroom, it is inevitable that unresolved psychic trouble from one's past will come to the surface. Buried thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories of trauma sometimes become conscious as the psyche repairs itself. This is not the torment of endlessly reliving the past, but part of genuine recovery from it.

Why are these things buried? Consciousness contracts after trauma. It withdraws from the world and higher functions like reflection and reason to focus its energies on stabilizing its basic unconscious structure. Awareness of the painful event itself often disturbs this process. Thus the trauma manifests as amnesia and denial: the inabilities to remember and to admit.

The form of amnesia we see in movies rarely occurs, so why do so many such movies continue drawing crowds? Because another form of amnesia is epidemic. In fact, it is called infant or childhood amnesia. Who remembers their birth or their first years? More to the point, who would want to? People and even "science" generally hold that memory does not reach back that far. But uncivilized and relatively untraumatized civilized people demonstrate something else, casually recounting details of leaving the womb, meeting their parents outside, and encountering the world around them for the first time.

Denial is not a moral failure. It is unconscious success. Trauma of such devastating nature usually occurs in infancy. It easily overwhelms an infant's structurally fragile consciousness. Denial prevents trauma from shattering basic psychic integrity, which would cause death (and sometimes does in SIDS: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). Denial is maintained until the psyche heals enough for one to bear witness to the horror of what has been denied. 

In darkness, denial begins to lift and traumatic events are remembered or acknowledged. Frozen feelings resurface, along with the general capacity for feeling. Insight comes. The organism paces this sometimes intense process with great care. The fact that it is happening proves you have the capacity to handle it. 

Gaining confidence in this capacity can take time. In [*protocol > discomfort*](/protocol#discomfort), I describe some ways I learned to moderate intense memory and feeling in darkness. In a series of [*reports*](/reports), I have recorded my experiences in darkness of beginning to heal from deep trauma.

What trauma? I mean the routine brutality of our lifeway, which touches virtually everyone from before birth. I mean not just the bad things we condemn, but common atrocities we mistakenly accept. I mean offenses to nature, as if it hadn't already worked out every detail of a happy existence from the beginning of time. 

I'm going to list common examples of the plague of polite violence I refer to. My editor, a deeply wise and loving man, has warned me I will lose readers by doing so. I see no way around it. Here's hoping you can take it.

- unintentional conception and ambivalent pregnancy
- birth intruders (doctor, midwife, priest, etc)
- post-partum attachment failure (through exhaustion, physical separation, and emotional unavailability)
- vaccination, circumcision, formula-milk, illegal public nursing
- absent, pushover, smothering, and abusive parents
- nannies and day care
- cribs, playpens, strollers (the worst designs of all time. They crystallize alienation in the nervous systems of billions.)
- television, computers, games (screen technology causes not mere atrophy, but lifelong damage to the imaginative faculty when much used at critical phases of development.[^6])
- factory food (including unripe harvesting, chemical farming, genetic modification, irradiation) 
- and finally, the last nail so big it splinters the coffin: school. 

The violence of job, military, hospital, the street, and prison go without saying.

Of exactly what brutalized _you_, you may already have some idea. I invite you to find out for sure for yourself in darkness, where you have a real chance to recover from it. Between retreats, the depth psychologists mentioned below can also help provide words for what you are going through.

Let's finally get it through our desensitized skulls: no one can get brutalized day in and day out for years without being affected. We are not indestructible. We are vulnerable to injury. This vulnerability is not a flaw. It is the conditional nature of organic existence that makes our spectacular adaptability possible. Personal failure results not from weakness. It simply indicates psychophysical malfunction resulting from deep damage, which was not our fault. We are not bad. We are hurt. We don't need to work harder. We need time to rest so we can heal.

Damage from major psychic trauma is real. It is deep. It persists through generations until it heals.[^7] Meanwhile, it disrupts everything else in our lives, motivating us to take it seriously. We can heal from it. We just need basic, decent conditions in which to do so: extended rest in quiet, well-ventilated darkness.

Lastly, unconscious psychic trauma often expresses itself somatically: as physical illness. If you are physically ill, you may well find psychic wounds underneath your condition, wounds of surprising intensity. These wounds are doors. On the other side of them lie unexpected paths back to physical health.

Much of this comes straight out of modern depth psychology: Wilhelm Reich, Jean Liedloff, Frederick Leboyer, Arthur Janov, Alice Miller, Joseph Chilton Pearce. In describing routine civilized brutality, they took heroic stands for humanity. Only, they did not imagine the psyche could repair itself without therapy.

Suffice it to say I'm no scientific materialist. This quaint philosophy holds that humans are so special that nature has exempted us from from its laws; and that anything generated through science (and by civilization itself) is inherently good. Find excellent elaborations of the humor in this idea in _Ishmael_ by Daniel Quinn and Rupert Sheldrake's critique of scientism. 

The human organism is resilient in some ways and vulnerable in others. Darkness provides our autonomic selves the opportunity to fully put these qualities to healthy use, righting unfathomable wrongs.

#### psychosis

We call situations and each other crazy all the time. But what if our colloquialism proved clinically accurate?

Sages throughout history have observed in us civilized people a pattern of _mass functional psychosis_. Mass means universal. Functional means able to survive long enough to raise children to reproducibility. Broadly, psychosis means psychic illness: trauma, exhaustion, toxification---absorption of poisonous ideas, attitudes, emotions, and behavior---and the resulting dysfunction in thinking, feeling, and moving intelligences. Dysfunction leads to failure and displeasure both physically, emotionally, and intellectually. Sure enough, sickness, unhappiness, and confusion (or dogmatism) characterize civilized people. Such comprehensive chronic dysfunction is the principal sign of our psychosis.

Narrowly, psychosis means the inability to distinguish reality from fantasy. Our particular fantasy is that the sliver of reality we are aware of makes up the whole of reality. Anything that doesn't fit into our postage stamp-worldview gets ignored or crushed. We can't help it. It's the inevitable pathology of mass major psychic trauma.

The sliver consists of the grossest part of reality. Scientists call it spacetime: three maneuverable dimensions of space, with one dimension of time, the present, frozen in a forward motion. Being grossly sensible, spacetime is especially amenable to intellection and mechanical manipulation. Thus our hypermental, industrial lifeway. We emphasize thinking at the expense of feeling and, to a lesser extent, action. Obsessive control of this sliver enables enough of us to survive each generation to imagine we are doing as well as possible.

Some of us find this imagining delusional given the widespread examples of mass psychosis that abound among us:

- righteous wars against the innocent
- controls in the name of freedom
- poverty amidst mind-boggling wealth
- useless work and wearisome recreation
- undernourishing overfeeding
- confusing philosophy and soulless religion
- alienation---civilization's calling card
- mass depression, anxiety, schizophrenia
- lifestyle diseases (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease)
- stupifying education
- sickening health care

That's just for starters. No doubt you can supply your own. Perhaps you have wept over the world's desperate madness. Perhaps you have wept over your own.

Normally, calling something crazy halts further consideration and conversation. After all, "you can't fix crazy." So what use is it to think or talk about it? Is it even craziness, or is it just human nature, as we have long assumed? Religion is helpless. Conventional psychology has failed to fix it, capitulating to psychiatry's narcosis. Mass psychosis is the biggest elephant in our room. 

I submit, we are actually crazy. We weren't always. Something went terribly wrong. But we are alive, therefore self-healing. So somehow we can recover.

What would we recover?

Awareness of the other basic plane of reality. Because it mirrors spacetime, some scientists call it timespace: three dimensions of time---past, present, future---and space compressed to one location. Australian Aboriginals call it dreamtime. They access it at will for daily living. It is how they can track someone 100 miles through the desert a year later with only a scrap of his clothing. Dreamtime is perceived through the feeling center of intelligence, not the senses. This is called intuition. With psychic integrity, it can be just as precise as the eyes aided by a microscope.

Our feeling centers, being more fragile, are generally out of commission. So to scientific materialists, dreamtime doesn't exist. They dismiss it out of hand despite the evidence. Which even most civilized people have a little of. I mean strange experiences that stick in the mind unexplained for decades, like personal x-files. If you talk about this stuff in conventional settings, others will call you crazy. But if you rest in darkness long enough, access to it promises to return permanently.

If the hygienic view of health and sanity is the brain of my method, and darkroom retreating is the gut---the action---then the testimony of mass functional psychosis is its broken heart. My online essay, [*psychosis*](/darkness-conjecture/psychosis), records it purely and forcefully.

#### causation

Pathology is the study of illness, especially its etiology: the chain of cause and effect that leads to symptoms. 

Hygiene is radical because it deals unflinchingly in first causes. It begins by observing that health is the normal state of organisms under normal conditions. Life itself started out in integrity and health. Nature cannot generate a diseased species. Disease only occurs when something goes wrong with conditions, when harmful ones are present and beneficial ones are absent or in poor proportion. 

This gives hygiene a rational standard for evaluating conditions proposed as beneficial. Hygiene asks, what normal relationship to life does this condition have? Did its absence cause the disease in the first place? If not, then its presence won't correct matters and we can dismiss the proposal.

Until now, hygienists have regarded the primary causes of disease as enervation, an excessive lowering of vitality, and toxemia, a general poisoning, mostly from internal waste but also food and environmental poisons. These, it is asserted, come from poor habits.

But from whence came poor habits? Why would a healthy creature engage in anything less than perfectly suitable? My answer is trauma. But 

In the case of using darkness to heal from psychic illness, well, once upon a time, we _were_ deprived the shelter we instinctively sought in order to heal from whatever traumatized us. We got hurt but got no chance to heal. Resting in a darkroom finally addresses this little-noticed intermediate cause of ongoing suffering and illness from major trauma.

Why were we deprived? Because directly or indirectly, our parents, our source of shelter, were also the source of our trauma. Busy inflicting one, they could not provide the other. It is the terrible truth we all know and spend most of our lives denying.

Of course, they suffered similar trauma at the hands of their parents. It rendered most of them incapable of providing us such shelter. They denied us rest just as they denied their own need for rest, just as their parents conditioned them to, just as their parents were equally traumatized, denied, and conditioned, going back 500 generations.

Everyone exists on many levels, not just such abstract ones. On a concrete level, all parents remain responsible for what they did and did not to children in their care. Only by holding parents responsible can we be responsible parents ourselves. The double burden is too much. Those who shield their parents from justice, even privately, inevitably unload the injustice they suffered upon their own children.

Major trauma injures, shocks, and disorients everyone concerned. One gets lost in the slow-motion nightmare of its infliction. Who deals the wound and who sustains it? Who was helpless and who was at fault? Of course the grown-ups start it. But kids feel it is their fault. The lines blur and before they know it, people have become their parents and the cycle begins again.

How did the snowball of trauma begin? Sane people do not hurt their children. Humanity was fine at some point. The trauma had to have originated externally. Self-correcting instinct is very strong. The trauma had to be _huge_ to knock so many of us so far off course for so long.

Some kind of super-[catastrophe](/darkness-conjecture/catastrophe) in our distant past must have done it. A supervolcano, a flood, a pole-shift triggering continent-sweeping tsunamis, a comet strike, an alien invasion. Who knows. Fact is, big rocks fly around space at high speeds. Occasionally, one lands here with unhappy consequences. We may be the butt of an cosmic joke.

If so, then our wars, big and small, are pointless. No one started it. Everyone is essentially innocent. So everyone is free to walk away from the conflict and heal. 

Trauma is natural. Trying to prevent all of it is futile. Hope lies in having a way to recover from it.[^8]

##### 

#### psychology

In light of the hygienic principle of _conditional self-preservation_, the restful use of darkness, and the traumatic origin of disease, a hygienic psychology can now be outlined:

1. As organisms, we start out whole, healthy, happy, and harmonious
2. Early major psychic trauma from civilization's routine brutality leaves us damaged, malfunctioning, and suffering.
3. The psyche, as an organic system, is self-healing, provided the proper conditions.
4. The primary condition of healing is _rest_ due to the homeostasis, stillness, and accumulation of vital energy it makes possible.
5. Profound psychic rest occurs physiologically in an extended period in absolutely dark environment.
6. Therefore, by resting in darkness, we are restored to wholeness, health, happiness, and harmony.

Hygiene upholds basic findings of psychology from several traditions. Hygiene merely shrugs at psychology's conscious over-involvement in the unconscious. The unconscious is competent to fix itself if minimally supported. The conscious is helpless in any case. We are correct in believing we have a problem and need to do something about it. We have been disastrously incorrect about which part of the self has to do it.[^9]

Focusing on deep psychic rest in absolute darkness is new in hygiene. Until now, it has focused on the profound physiological rest of fasting. Fasting has been hygiene's ultimate means of dealing with serious illness. At most, hygiene recommends keeping eyes closed during fasts because it reduces the significant work of sensory processing of vision[^10]. A darkroom retreat embodies this principle fully while providing the energy and, frankly, the psychic security of food until the underlying psychic system necessary for fasting has repaired itself.

In other words, these systems are more fundamental than the digestive and eliminative systems. Darkroom retreating is thus more urgently needed than fasting in most cases.

Furthermore, darkroom retreating is inherently much safer to do alone. Fasting requires basic psychic integrity, self-knowledge, and a comprehensive grasp of hygiene and fasting in particular. Awareness of internal sensations and their meanings becomes clear and fine-grained. This integrity and knowledge intensifies motivation to learn hygiene. Thus hygienic darkroom retreating will open the door to unsupervised long fasts on a wide scale.

Professional hygienic fasting supervisors attempt to substitute themselves for these prerequisites of fasting or teach them in the usual slow, incomplete way. Consequently, only hundreds of people fast per year in a remotely proper way, not the billions who need to. Hygienic darkroom retreating recontexualizes the work of fasting supervisors. Retreating in darkness themselves, they will regain the capacity to operate at a global scale, not just with the lucky few.

As in fasting, one hardly knows in darkness what the organism is doing at its deepest levels. Occasionally there is a chance to consciously participate in the process. Or to find out _why_ things have gone wrong if it is important to change ideas and behavior related to it. At mostly one feels discomfort or a strange subterranean rumbling.

But one always knows the result: restoration of function---recovery of the lost self---usually accompanied by feelings of contentedness, presence, and euphoria. Darkroom retreating reveals the marvelous self-healing power of the organism under proper conditions. But for those who have suffered and failed for years with other approaches, the process is nothing less than miraculous. As with the rest of hygiene, time in darkness shows that if one wants a miracle, one need only provide its conditions.

And then? Healed from trauma, one will no longer be compelled to repeat it. One will absorb and redeem its consequences. As with the rest of Natural Hygiene, hygienic psychology's bad news is much worse, and its good news is far better than anyone dreamed.

The emergence of a hygienic psychology, its identification of trauma at the root of all illness, and its greater importance than fasting have massive implications for hygiene's pathology and destiny. Hygiene has said illness originates with enervation (low energy) and toxemia. Trauma explains how these conditions themselves originate. And in coming to terms with trauma, Natural Hygiene can finally meet and obsolete allopathy (Western medicine) in its stronghold. I have developed these implications in [*hygiene notes*](/darkness-conjecture/hygiene-notes).

I am only saying enough here to give you a theoretical basis for doing hygienic darkroom retreats. For a thorough introduction to hygiene's principles, practices, and intriguing history, read Shelton's [*The Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene*](https://darkroomretreat.com/nhs.pdf).
