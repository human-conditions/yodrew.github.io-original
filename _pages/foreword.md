This book comes out of a long investigation into the cause of joy. 

At 15, great joy spontaneously overcame me. It felt normal. It eclipsed my other concerns. When it disappeared after three heavenly months, I felt gripped by the need to solve its mystery.

After 21 years of investigation, I did. I discovered the way nature provides us to heal from major trauma, joy's destroyer. Four years of testing followed, then four more of refinement and documentation.

Briefly, joy is a function of being alive, not effort. Lack of joy indicates a damaged system, not moral failure. Given conditions of profound rest, this damage heals by itself, and joy returns.

Effort, our lifeway's smug panacea, gives false and fleeting results. With the will, one can do nothing directly to restore joy. One can only support the organism in doing it autonomically.

For 10,000 years, we civilized people have been correct that something is terribly wrong with ourselves and that we must do something about it. But we've mistaken which part of ourselves must do it. At long last, this book puts the issue _to rest_.
