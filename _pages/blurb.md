### a complete manual

Hygienic darkroom retreating consists of resting in an absolutely dark room for days, alone, with food. Why do this? To  recover psychic balance by taking refuge from the over-stimulation of civilized existence. 

This seemingly trivial contrast can lead to a remarkable and lasting restoration of your well-being, making the darkroom a powerful tool.

The book explains why a retreat works, how to do it, and how to make a darkroom. It includes detailed plans and instructions to attain these effects in your own home.

### toward a hygienic psychology

Spiritual traditions have used darkness for millennia. This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---strictly for the purpose of health. Not just cleanliness, hygiene (or hygienism) is a whole philosophy of health. It respects life's self-preserving nature and posits its normal conditions---fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc---as sufficient to both maintain and restore health.

Emerging in 1832, hygiene resulted in the 19th century's massive improvement in public health worldwide. Though little acknowledged, hygiene remains historyâ€™s most successful and widespread approach to health.

As with fasting, a hygienic darkroom retreat is a normal condition temporarily extended to attain profound rest for the purpose of healing. Healing occurs _autonomically_: by itself. The conscious self merely maintains the conditions that support it.

Hygiene has long excelled in caring for the self-healing body. With darkroom retreating, hygiene now has an equally effective way of caring for the self-healing soul. This completes hygiene and holds staggering implications for individuals, society, and the world.
