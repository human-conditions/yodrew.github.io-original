##### a complete manual

Hygienic darkroom retreating consists of resting in an absolutely dark room for days, alone, with food. Why do this? To recover psychic balance by taking refuge from the sensory over-stimulation of civilized existence.

This seemingly trivial contrast can lead to a remarkable and lasting restoration of your well-being, making the darkroom a powerful tool.

The book explains why a retreat works, how to do it, and how to make a darkroom, including detailed instructions to attain these effects in your own home.

##### toward a hygienic psychology

This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---based on hygiene. Not just cleanliness, hygiene is an entire philosophy of health based on the self-preserving nature of life and all its normal conditions: fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc. Since 1832, hygiene has taught the modern world these conditions, causing massive increases in public health worldwide, and becoming historyâ€™s most influential approach to health. 

A hygienic darkroom retreat is a set of normal conditions, temporarily extended as with fasting. Therefore it is neither disciplined, therapeutic, nor psychedelic. Organisms are self-healing. Healing is autonomic. Conscious processes only support healing by maintaining conditions.

Hygiene has long excelled in caring for the self-healing body. With darkroom retreating, hygiene now has an equally effective way of caring for the self-healing soul. The restful use of darkness completes hygiene and holds staggering implications for individuals, society, and the world.
