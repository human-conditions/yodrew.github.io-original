#### toward a hygienic psychology

Indigenous and spiritual traditions have used physical darkness for millennia. This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---based on hygiene. Not just cleanliness, hygiene is the science of _health_. Hygiene recognizes the self-preserving nature of life and all its normal conditions: fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc. Darkness enables the full application of its principles to the organic system of the psyche.

Hygiene began to show nature's way to industrial civilization in 1832. Worldwide massive improvements in public health followed. Benefits continue for billions who never see doctors or even understand the terminology. Hygiene is historyâ€™s most influential approach to health. 

A hygienic darkroom retreat provides all conditions of profound rest, which healing requires. These are normal conditions, perfected and temporarily extended, as in fasting. The psyche heals itself _autonomically_ of even the worst that life deals us. The result: reliable miracles.
