#### intro

I believe joy is natural. I searched nature for its cause. She showed me.

From this, I developed a solution to suffering. It is called hygienic darkroom retreating. I am starting a business to bring it to the world.

Joy comes from being whole. From _biological integrity_. Lack of joy indicates damaged integrity. One thing damages it: major trauma. Chronically unhealed major trauma is the root cause of suffering. 

Yet trauma is also natural. The collisions in a material universe cause it. So nature, in its perfection, provides the means to heal from it. 

As organisms, we are self-healing, provided the proper conditions. The primary condition of healing is profound rest. The most profound rest occurs in darkness. 

Given enough time in darkness, major trauma can heal completely and in all its effects. Nothing is wrong anymore. Suffering ends. Joy returns.

Gradually, I developed a model of the restful use of darkness. Its pattern of _conditional self-preservation_  matches hygiene, the science of health. So it is called _hygienic darkroom retreating_. It reliably leads to miracles:

- relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness
- restoration of the personal power necessary for freedom
- return of the lost self

My readers and I only glimpsed these benefits in trial retreats. Now, with a complete model, everyone can benefit fully. It just needs a self-supporting, team. Thus...

#### startup

I am starting a business. We will do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating: research, development, instruction, service, and manufacturing.

To begin funding it, I am: 

- preselling hosted retreats, our most needed product
- selling 
	- consultations and remote retreat support
	- credit: product-backed, appreciating  toward these and dozens of future products
- introducing the catalog to gauge interest and schedule production
	- services: (see above) 
    - information: my book in paper, lectures, training
    - goods: darkroom, componentry, tech, microfactory, neighborhood, franchise
- using the startup process to further form the business and attract capital

The vision of Human Conditions is rapid, worldwide restoration of the original human condition of joy, health, and freedom. The mission of Human Conditions is to make darkness approachable by ordinary people on normal terms. 

Realizing a vision depends on its scalability. Among positive influences, that of powerful people scales fastest. An individual restored to wholeness has mythic-scale power. In his presence, even the materially powerful forget who they are and what they were doing and want only to know him. His radiant presence is irresistable. It is the ultimate disarmament.

The model applies to every field. Restored individuals will use it to transform not merely an industry, but redefine the world's economy and our entire way of life. 

Achieving our mission means making the business a turnkey, franchise operation. _Click_, and it just works. I mean perfectly, beautifully, in every way, for everyone involved. 

Human Conditions will be the first darkroom operation to meet this world-class standard. People have no time for anything less. There is no reason they should. 

This remains true even now. The world is in dire need of a sane, practical vision of life. Yet the soul maintains its composure at all costs. Awaiting the real solution, it endures all. Only nature can provide one. The first plausible candidate has emerged.

- notes
    - Ψ prioritized products; others are scheduled around these.
    - *designs are conceived but neither described fully nor illustrated in my book nor prototyped. Some have links to short descriptions or mentions
    - all products subject to improvement by superior design or process, early delivery, lowered price, etc
    - more goods and services for a hygienic lifeway to come

#### goal

The goal is $13,400 in sales. One-third will cover the items below. Two-thirds will cover costs: production, labor, and debts. 

The schedule for paying for these is staged. Once sales reach $5000, we will set up the darkroom. I will make up any shortfall through the startup process (see plan).

Amounts exclude shipping.

| Stage | Item                                    | Amount | Total |
|:-----:|:--------------------------------------- | ------:| ----: |
| 1     | legal counsel for forming business      |   3000 |  8000 |
| 2     | darkroom setup and two critical debts   |   5000 |  5000 |
| 3     | assembly drawings for book              |   3000 | 11000 |
| 4     | copy editing, proofreading, book design |   2400 | 13400 |

#### plan

Steps are roughly in order. Some are concurrent.

1. pre-launch
    - design presale 
    - set up website for presale
    - find members of my network to share presale with their networks
    - create incentive for everyone who does
2. presale
    - reach first stage of goal
    - rent house for darkroom, buy tools and materials, prepare darkroom (long-time collaborators come from Sweden to help)
    - update and expand promotion of presale
3. operate darkroom
	- test and refine
	- train apprentices
	- retreat and support their retreats
	- open darkroom to first clients (you!)
4. edit book
    - integrate final pieces of model
    - refine organization of book content
    - simplify sentence structure for clarity, easier reading, and more accurate machine translation
    - hire draftsman to make assembly drawings
    - get book copyedited, proofread, and designed
    - print and ship on schedule
5. develop business
    - study startup process 
    - create pitch deck, investment plan, and other standard documents
    - use documents to present the business to attract further funding and team members
    - begin organizing work together
6. prototype prefab darkroom
7. develop and produce: 
    - info services
	    - lecture:
    	     - refine existing talk according to model
        	 - begin speaking in public
    	- seminar: plan and organize
    - components
    	- develop production processes and tooling 
    	- refine prototypes
    	- produce and ship components on schedule
8. final
    - offer medium retreats, produce darkroom
    - develop computer and ventilation tech
    - offer long retreats, produce microfactory kits, design neighborhood
    - expand catalog with related products from others

Note: Fact is, things rarely go to plan. But things can get done somehow, either on time or with communication about and compensation for delay. This is our approach.

#### Team

If you would like to participate in this with us, inquire. We would like to talk to you. Every sort of unconventional and remote arrangement is possible. All kinds can help make this work. We have already collaborated extesively and supported darkroom construction and retreats worldwide through Telegram. 

Essential qualifications are:

- reasonableness
- having read my book 
- some experience whatsoever in darkness that enabled you to sense the value of hygienic darkroom retreating for yourself. People have retreated in bathrooms and garden sheds, camped in a closet, and tacked blankets over windows and stapled together a sleeping mask.

- Core
	- Marion Abbott, 65, Australia, is an uncompromising, eccentric truth-seeker like me. Our conversations for 4.5 years have been critical to the final stage of development as well as my survival. She has acted heroically to understand and apply my work and integrate its effects. She has done 4 retreats
	- Simen Kirkerod, 43, Norway, quit psychedelics for darkness after a long search. He is a carpenter and budding entrepreneur. He has spurred development since 2014. He has done 7 hygienic darkroom retreats for longer periods than I have. 
	- Both core members of the team are long-term dedicated collaborators. Both found the solution to their personal dilemmas in my work and have invested significant time and money in bringing it to fruition.

#### risks

As this is what I do all the time, the one major risk is delay. The world's apocalyptic weirdness is intensifying. As with most people, it has delayed me in some things.

To cope with this influence, my plan includes backups for resiliency. We will not depend on any one strategy, vendor, investor, or even country of location. We design products for portability and distributed manufacture to minimize costs of relocation as well as shipping. 

For stability with flexibility, we prioritize critical products (Ψ) for delivery when and in the order given. Delivery of other products will follow demand and be more subject to circumstances.

Politically, economically, and health-wise, I am currently vulnerable. The design of this presale will amend these. The counsel I will retain will help with these issues and the strange changes occurring globally. 

Distributed states are arising to replace centralized states and to temper their death-bed measures. We will develop functions of governance---defense, judiciary, intelligence, diplomacy---as a node in this growing network.

I have learned from my last crowdfunding campaign. I raised the money but did not achieve my objective: a 20-day retreat. It did expose deeper obstacles, primarily my lack of personal power. I have started to overcome them. Here is a table of the major differences between the campaigns:

Comparison of Campaigns

| issue | aspects | 2020 | 2016 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| context |  |  |  | 
|  | scope | life's work | one-time event |
|  | purpose | trade | charity |
|  | team | yes| no |
|  | country | world capital | unsympathetic | 
|  | timing | uncertain | fair | 
| model |  | developed | incomplete | 
|  | theory | mapped out | blind spots | 
|  | support | plenty, committed | scant, unsympathetic | 
|  | design | mature | experimenting | 
| personal |  |  |  |
|  | suicidal | no | yes | 
|  | personal power | studied, growing | ignorant, deficient | 
|  | soul | reconnected | empty | 
| viability |  | medium-high | low | 

As long as one is powerless, he and others are liabilities to each other. Power opens the door to relationship, collaboration, and success. I rely on my team to continue seeing what I do not.

#### qualifications 

My family and elders prepared me for my mission from before conception till age 16. Independent investigation followed for 21 years until discovering of darkness and integrating it with hygiene. Eleven years of its development followed. I was born for this. I have done only it my entire life.

My father was a serial entrepreneur. I was constantly whisked behind the scenes of businesses of associates, friends, and family to see how they worked. His factories and offices were my playgrounds and later, workplaces. I worked around consultants and did a little consulting myself. I have worked closely with entrepreneurs in both publishing and manufacturing. 

Except where noted, I have produced or prototyped most things in the catalog. I have experience in shipping things internationally from both America and Europe.

I have read business books since my teens. I know double-entry accounting, simple programming, basic law, history, philosophy. Above all, I have recovered enough personal power to begin succeeding in a rough and tumble world. The ultimate means of recovering the rest lies in my possession.

Delay accompanies our extreme circumstances. So does demand for my specialty: extreme measures. Darkness is an idea whose time has come. I am a survivor with a unique set of skills. I will find a way to execute my plan and fill your order.

#### conclusion

Archimedes said, "Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world." Of course, he was thinking of the world from the outside as a planetary mass. Ayn Rand thought of the world from the inside as a social system. She suggested that the individual human soul is the small lever at its center, activating all its processes.

Nature has revealed darkness to me as the means of liberating the soul. It opens the bottleneck we are stuck in. In darkness, the soul rapidly restores itself and becomes able to restore the world. 

We stand at a crucial moment in history. From one direction comes a grim and sick society. It presses us noisily toward slavery. From the other direction, comes ever-perfect nature. Quietly, she presses into our hands the biological key to joy, health, and freedom.

Life alerted me to its existence at 16. My purpose became finding it, then working out its operation. This stretched me to the breaking point numberless times. Somehow, it kept easing me back. Where many others sold out or gave up, or got sidetracked or cut down, the way through kept opening up for me. Relentlessness has its benefits.

Thank you for your ongoing interest, consideration, and support. Today, we begin yet again.
