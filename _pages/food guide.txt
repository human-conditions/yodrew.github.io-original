Food guide for hygienic darkroom retreat

Drink 3L of water a day

Most of the time, just eat plain fruit. 
  - eat one kind at a time until you lose your taste for it
  - eat from the most watery (melons) to the least (bananas, dates)

Then:

sweet green salads (midday or evenings)

1 head romaine, chopped
2 L watermelon, chopped (only combine one kind of melon with one green, otherwise stomach ache)
---
1/2 head romaine, chopped
3 ribs celery, finely chopped
5 sprigs parsley
4 bananas, ripe
1 L strawberries or blueberries or chopped nectarines
---
1 head romaine, chopped
3 oranges, peeled, sectioned, cut in half
2 apples, chopped
2 slices pineapple, chopped


savory salads (evenings)

1 head romaine, chopped
3 ribs celery, finely chopped
1dL rocket lettuce (or some spicy green)
1 orange, chopped very finely (into pulp)
4dL tomato, chopped
1/2 avocado or 1dL olives
---
1 head romaine, chopped
10 sprigs parsley or cilantro
1 orange, chopped very finely 
1 red bell pepper, chopped finely
5 mushrooms, chopped OR 1 zuchinni, chopped

Come up with your own based on above patterns. The trick with savory salads (and all combined food, really) is to make sure all 8 flavors/textures are present:

bitter, sweet, sour, salty, savory, spicy, fatty, crunchy

- bitter: tender greens like romaine and young spinach, mild culinary herbs like parsley, cilantro. Also celery
- sweet: fruit
- sour: orange, grapefruit, lemon
- salty: celery, tomatoes (especially dried)
- savory: tomatoes, olives (rinse off oil)
- spicy: hot, but just a hint, barely enough to notice. Spicy greens are best, like rocket, arugala, mustard, cilantro
- fatty
  - 1 time in a 4-day retreat
  - oiliness of lettuce is usually enough
  - eat a small quantity: 1/2 avocado, 15 olives, or 1 teaspoon tahini
  - eat only one kind of fatty food per day, in darkness or out
  - stick mostly to fatty fruits, avocado and olives (rinse off oil). Eat nuts or seeds only 1-2 times/month
  - eat 5-10% of your daily calories from fat. Look up calories for a week to learn this. It is surprisingly easy to overeat fat, and it causes serious problems
- crunchy: lots of things

NO: 
- vinegar or other ferments
- onions, garlic, ginger
- salt
- spices 
- juice, oil, or other fractured foods

These destroy digestive chemistry, bacteria, and enzymes. Good things you hear about vinegar, garlic, and ginger are hype.
