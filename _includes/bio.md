Born 1971, Twin Falls, Idaho. From age 16, I sought the cause of joy. I independently studied philosophy, health, and design. I tested my findings while traveling America. I lived outside or in small groups, doing odd jobs, playing music, and building alternative shelter. 

In 2008, my quest culminated in [_the darkness conjecture_](/darkness-conjecture/), a concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the selfâ€‹-healing psyche. I began:

- designing and building darkrooms and doing and supporting retreats in America, Guatemala, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Czech Republic
- giving talks and consulting for readers
- refining and documenting my work at [darkroomretreat.com](/). 

Proof of concept came in 2013. I completed development of the model of hygienic darkroom retreating in 2019. Now I am forming an organization to prototype and advance the model worldwide.
