##### rest, relief, recovery

A hygienic darkroom retreat consists of _resting_ in a totally dark room for an extended period. One is alone inside, with supporters outside. There is food. The room is safe, quiet, comfortable, and well-ventilated.

Why do this? For:

- relief from distress and overstimulation
- rest from exhaustion and depression
- recovery from trauma and disease

This is a complete manual, with theory, protocol, and design. It explains why retreating works and how to do it. It includes drawings and instructions for beginning at home.

##### toward a hygienic psychology

Neither spiritual, therapeutic, nor psychedelic, this is the first approach to darkness based on hygiene. Hygiene is the science of health, a branch of biology. It respects life's self-preserving nature. It identifies life's normal conditions: air, warmth, work, relationship, cleanliness, etc.

Hygiene started in 1832 and rapidly spread worldwide. The 19th century's famous improvements in public health resulted. Now its rudiments are common sense. Billions who never see doctors benefit from hygiene daily. But few know it formally---or its greatest benefits.

In darkness, hygiene finds its missing link: a psychology. Now it can extend its superlative care to the organic system of the psyche. This proves to be the key to health. The result: reliable miracles.
