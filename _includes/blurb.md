This complete manual explains why a retreat works, how to do it, and how to make a darkroom at home. It shows that miracles are easy. Simply provide their conditions.

##### toward a hygienic psychology

Indigenous and spiritual traditions have used physical darkness for millennia. This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---based on hygiene. Not just cleanliness, hygiene is the _science of health_. Hygiene recognizes the self-preserving nature of life and all its normal conditions. These include fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc. Darkness enables the full application of its principles to the organic system of the psyche.

Hygiene began to show nature's way to industrial civilization in 1832. Worldwide massive improvements in public health followed. Benefits continue for billions who never see doctors or even understand the terminology. Hygiene is historyâ€™s most influential approach to health. 

The primary requirement of healing is profound rest. A hygienic darkroom retreat provides all its conditions, perfected and temporarily extended, as in fasting. The psyche heals itself autonomically of even the greatest injuries. The result: reliable miracles.
