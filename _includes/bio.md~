Born 1971, Twin Falls, Idaho. From age 16, I searched for the cause of joy. I independently studied philosophy, health, and design. I tested my findings while traveling America, living outside or in small groups, doing odd jobs, playing music, and building alternative shelter. 

In 2008, my quest culminated in [_the darkness conjecture_](/darkness-conjecture/), a concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the self​-healing psyche. I began:

- designing and building darkrooms and supporting retreats in Guatemala, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Czech Republic
- giving lectures and consulting for readers
- refining and documenting my work at [darkroomretreat.com](/). 

Proof of concept came in 2013. I completed development of the model of hygienic darkroom retreating in 2019. A group is forming an organization to prototype and advance the model worldwide.
