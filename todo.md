templates will need a special knife holder that guides the knife in the grooves so the knife and creaser can never be confused and the template does not get cut up. It will slide in a groove wider than the creaser. It can be easily made.

# TEXT

---our media blitz, cities, and economy---And in our souls, we struggle and suffer. We need peace and joy.

I'm a psychologist who disbelieves in civilization. But I'm not a scholar. So I have not read Freud's _Civilization and Its Discontents_. I just heard a couple things about it and it's all I want to know: 

- Our suffering comes from trauma, which comes from civilization.
