# 4 - prepare {#prepare}

These are a few things that will help you prepare for a retreat: the registration form I have used with clients, the food menu, and a list of things to bring. Whether retreating at home or at a center, I suggest you read it and fill out the questionnaire to help you prepare mentally for the retreat. Likewise, give it to those whose retreats you support.

## menu {#menu}

Here is the hygienic food plan:

- frugivorous menu
    - fresh fruit and leafy green vegetables (lettuce, celery, spinach, culinary herbs)
    - whole, raw, ripe, well-washed, and amply provided for eating anytime
    - green salad: sweet or savory, large, properly combined, served at midday
    - not served: juice, oil, spices, salt, onions, garlic, ginger, or ferments (like vinegar).
- if you would like to know more about this menu before trying it, read the food sections in [____*hygiene*____](#hygiene) and [____*protocol*____](#protocol) and Dr Douglas Graham's  
[____*The 80/10/10 Diet*____](http://foodnsport.com)
- if you somehow cannot eat this way, eat as simply and naturally as you know how. For suggestions, write me with your limitations.
