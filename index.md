Hygienic darkroom retreating consists of resting in an absolutely dark room for days, alone, with food. Why do this? To recover psychic balance by taking refuge from the sensory over-stimulation of civilized existence.

This seemingly trivial contrast can lead to a remarkable and lasting restoration of your well-being, making the darkroom a powerful tool.

The book explains why a retreat works, how to do it, and how to make a darkroom, including detailed plans and instructions to attain these effects in your own home.

##### toward a hygienic psychology

As with fasting, a hygienic darkroom retreat is a set of normal conditions, temporarily extended. Healing occurs _autonomically_. The conscious self supports this unconscious self-healing by maintaining conditions.

Spiritual traditions have used darkness for millennia. This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---based on hygiene. Not just cleanliness, hygiene is an entire philosophy of health. It is rooted in two natural facts: life is self-preserving, and it is conditional. Self-preservation is instinctive down to the cellular level. Normal conditions of life obtain in nature and a natural way of life: fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc.

Since 1832, hygiene has taught industrial society appreciation for nature's way. Worldwide massive increases in public health quickly resulted. Though little acknowledged, hygiene remains history’s most successful and influential approach to health.

Hygiene has long excelled in caring for the self-healing body. With darkroom retreating, hygiene now has an equally effective way of caring for the self-healing soul. This completes hygiene and holds staggering implications for individuals, society, and the world.
