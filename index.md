#### relief, rest, recovery

Hygienic darkroom retreating means resting in an absolutely dark room for days, alone, with food. Why do it? 

- instant relief from distress and overstimulation
- profound rest from exhaustion
- complete recovery from injury and illness

Healing super-intensifies. Energy, clarity, and joy return. Health and sanity are restored. The lost self returns.

This complete manual explains why a retreat works, how to do it, and how to make a darkroom at home.

#### toward a hygienic psychology

Indigenous and spiritual traditions have used darkness for millennia. This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---based on hygiene. Not just cleanliness, hygiene is the biological science of _health_. It is based on life's self-preserving nature and its normal conditions: fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc. Its principles apply equally to the psyche, an organic system.

Hygiene began teaching industrial society to appreciate nature's way in 1832. Worldwide massive improvements in public health followed. Hygiene is historyâ€™s most influential approach to health. 

A hygienic darkroom retreat provides conditions of profound rest. These are normal and temporarily extended, as in fasting. The psyche proceeds to heal itself, even of the worst trauma. The conscious self merely maintains the conditions of this _autonomic_ self-healing, with reliably miraculous results.
