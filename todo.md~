How do people believe the fantasies that they do? Because they have fantasies about their beliefs themselves! They believe their own beliefs to be other than what they are. First they misrepresent reality, then they misrepresent their misrepresentations to themselves to appear representational.

How do people do _this_?


How does someone believe in fantasies? By fantasizing about the beliefs themselves. He believes his own beliefs to be other than what they are. First he misrepresents reality, then he misrepresents his misrepresentations to himself to appear valid. It's perfect symmetry and usually undetected for a lifetime except symbolically.

How does he do _this_? What makes it possible? The mind is a logic machine. The body and heart are part of a larger system with it. They all work together. Wherever there is contradiction, there is tension, confusion, distress, pain. Suffering intensifies until resolution... or death.

Only a malfunctioning system can persist in error.

templates will need a special knife holder that guides the knife in the grooves so the knife and creaser can never be confused and the template does not get cut up. It will slide in a groove wider than the creaser. It can be easily made.

In fact, in the history of medicine, those most fascinated with this priestly duty became doctors, assuming the cover of science as necessary, but always pursuing this line.

The hygienic use of darkness promises to put all industries and institutions out of business, including esoteric spiritual traditions. Civilization itself becomes obsolete.

***which relies on the efficacy of autonomic functions, 
This is the meaning of poise in hygiene.

Like virtually all serious and well-known hygienists, they are both the targets of smear campaigns. 

Countless people have dedicated their lives to solving our problem for thousands of years, defining it in every conceivable way, trying every possible answer. One had to turn up eventually.

I'm a psychologist who disbelieves in civilization. But I'm not a scholar. So I have not read Freud's _Civilization and Its Discontents_. I just heard a couple things about it and it's all I want to know: 

- Our suffering comes from trauma, which comes from civilization, which comes from cataclysm
