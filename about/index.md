Welcome. This website contains my book, <em>darkroom retreat</em>, related writings, and a blog.

#### bio

Born 1971, Twin Falls, Idaho. For 21 years, I traveled America while searching for the cause of joy. I independently studied philosophy, health, and design, testing my findings by living outside, doing odd jobs, playing music, and building alternative shelter. 

In 2008, my quest culminated in _the darkness conjecture_, a concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the selfâ€‹-healing psyche. I spent the years since proving the concept; designing and building darkrooms and supporting retreats in Guatemala, Sweden, Norway, and Spain; giving lectures and consulting for readers; and documenting my work at [andrewdurham.com](/).
