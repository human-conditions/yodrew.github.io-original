Welcome to the political-economy of _cool_, where you get rewarded for cooperating, not threatened with punishment, if you don't.

1. [Copyleft](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/) 2009-2015 by [Andrew Durham](/). Copying is an act of [â™¥](http://copyheart.org). Please copy, distribute, and sell (yes, _sell_) my writings and industrial applications of them, ie, darkroom components, in any media or business venture for your own personal gain. 
2. I will recognize and link to you on this site if you:
    - credit me in quotation or excerpt and tell me where it is appearing
    - share improvements by sending [pull requests](https://github.com/yodrew/drh) or [email](/about)
    - include this license in your whole or partial reprints of this book and with instructions accompanying componentry
    - include a printed or electronic copy of this book with componentry
3. Furthermore, I will also give you my [endorsement](http://questioncopyright.org/creator_endorsed), a visible mark to use in your marketing copy if you: 
    - share with me part of your earnings from:
        - reprints of my writings (8% of retail price for print and 70-90% for ebooks)
        - reproductions of darkroom components (1% of retail price)
    - and/or somehow astound me

    See [home page/help out](/)/ for how to send me money.

    Basically, this means you can instantly become my publisher or manufacturer! These deals roughly equal what you and I would make if I were published or self-published and you were simply selling the books, without your having to order from me in bulk, pay shipping, keep legally complicated records, or sign a contract. 
    
    The idea is to make the book and componentry available with minimal friction in every way, at every level of distribution.
