# license {#license}

Welcome to the political-economy of _cool_, where you get rewarded for cooperating, not threatened with punishment if you don't.

1. [____Copyleft____](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/) 2009-2015 by [____Andrew Durham____](http://darkroomretreat.com/). Copying is an act of [____â™¥____](http://copyheart.org). Please copy, distribute, and sell (yes, _sell_) my writings and industrial applications of them, ie, darkroom components, in any media or business venture for your own personal gain.
2. I would like credit where due, so I will recognize and link to you on this site if you:
    - credit me in quotation or excerpt and tell me where it is appearing
    - share improvements by sending [____pull requests____](https://github.com/yodrew/yodrew.github.io) or [____*email*____](#bio)
    - include this license in your whole or partial reprints of this book and with instructions accompanying componentry
    - include a printed or electronic copy of this book with componentry
3. Furthermore, I will also give you my [____endorsement____](http://questioncopyright.org/creator_endorsed), a visible mark to use in your marketing copy if you: 
    - share with me part of your earnings from:
        - reprints of my writings (8% of retail price for print and 70-90% for e-books)
        - reproductions of darkroom components (1% of retail price)
    - and/or somehow astound me

    See [____home page > help out____](http://darkroomretreat.com/) for how to send me money.

    Basically, this means you can instantly become my publisher or manufacturer! These deals roughly equal what you and I would make if I were published or self-published and you were simply selling the books, yet without your having to order from me in bulk, pay shipping, keep legally complicated records, or sign a contract. 
    
    The idea is to make the book and componentry available with minimal friction in every way, at every level of distribution, so that people can retreat asap. If anything about this license conflicts with that, let me know.
