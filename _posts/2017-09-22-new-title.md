I changed the name of the site and book. As darkroom retreating is growing a lot, I find it increasingly necessary to differentiate the hygienic from the usual spiritual, therapeutic, and psychedelic approaches. "Deep rest" unfortunately sounds like depressed, and other hygienists use the phrase, "profound rest", so I changed that, too. The essence of the book remains the same, or more so. I have new sections planned and will write them as soon as I am capable. Cheers.
