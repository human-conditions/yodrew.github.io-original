Individualist politics is not enough. It needs an individualist form of government to match it.

Individualism has relied on centralized states. But they are inherently collectivist, with their delegation of power, representation, voting, secret societies, and arcane rules and laws. They chew up individualist aims and spit them out as collectivist tyranny. Structure primarily determines function, inputs secondarily.

Ironically, the solution is the distributed organization of collectivist activism. Distribution suits rebelliousness and individual initiative. But collectivism's function is despotism. Once power is attained, distribution gives way to centralization.

Individualism's function is liberation. Distribution can remain as its natural, permanent form of government.
