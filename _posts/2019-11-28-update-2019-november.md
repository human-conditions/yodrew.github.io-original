Here are the three things I figured out this month.

1. The first phase of development of hygienic darkroom retreating (hdr) is finished.
2. My failure to do a 20-day retreat all this time was a tactical necessity
3. I must tell people my work is mature and needs capitalization: team, money, organization, etc.

Now I will explain these.

1. First phase

I developed short retreats over 11 years. I had to work alone to establish basic principles. On this foundation, we can develop medium and long retreats faster and more easily.

Development ended this autumn when I saw three things:

- last pieces of the method
    - air filtration
    - bed design
    - the infinite nature of the self (thanks to George Kavassilas). It shows that we have the access we need now to the deep self we will completely recover in darkness
- method as a whole
    - importance of and high standards necessary for all pieces. I tried for years to get by on quick, cheap solutions. That was fine for testing. But for full application, everything needs serious attention.
    - how they all work together. The main elements are:
        - darkroom
        - retreatant
        - supporters
- place of method in the world
    - humanity has huge potential
        - the hygienic use of darkness has political implications. By recovering wholeness, we recover personal power, the basis of freedom.
        - in darkness, we can pull ourselves together to deal with huge changes predicted for Earth in the near future 
    - malevolent forces oppose us
        - ruled by deception and force, we begin at a disadvantage
        - we are each damaged and conditioned as slaves
    
It has been a strange six months. I had worked for 11 years like a juggernaut. My momentum blinded me to the fact that I was reaching the end. Somehow, I had to slow down and reorient. I subconsciously arranged the theft of my computer, the destruction of my smartphone, and recently, getting defrauded of a significant amount of money. It was shocking and discouraging. But it got me to stop. 

After my computer was stolen, I read George's book (darkroomretreat.com/f/journey.pdf). That helped a lot. I did one more retreat. It was a failure, but I found the last pieces there.

2. Failure to retreat

During these months of reflection, I figured out the answers to my dreadful questions:

- Why have I failed to retreat for 20-days, as I have intended for all these years?
- If hygienic darkroom retreating is so great, why am I still unwell?

I have failed because a 20-day retreat requires a fully developed method, a trained team, and an excellent darkroom. None of these existed yet. Even now, the method is still partly in my head, not fully in my book yet.

The greatness of hygienic darkroom retreating has only been potential, not actual. I have always seen it. But until it is realized, I cannot apply it fully and heal. 

One might think I would have at least not gotten worse. But two other factors came into play.

- A retreat long enough to heal requires a team. But I could not work with others at first. The same sensitivity that enabled me to discover darkness makes me vulnerable to others' influence. I could not protect the vision I had from them. I had to work alone till it was stable in my mind. My condition worsened with my exhaustion. Now, the method cannot be compromised. This is all that matters. Everything lost can be recovered in darkness.
- I hurt myself with too many 4-day retreats. I did not know their danger. Doing a couple 4-day retreats is fine. But I did 15! They strip a person of artificial survival skills. Normal capacity replaces these in darkness, but this takes at least an 8-day retreat. See darkroomretreat.com/hygiene#false-capacity and darkroomretreat.com/format#warning for more.

    A 4-day retreat was enough to glimpse the potential of darkness, to get relief and begin healing, and to develop the method. So I kept going. But the cost has been very great. Some days, I cling to life. This is tragic and frightening. I live on hope for a chance to recover.

    I should be in a hospital under 24 hour care. But the hospital I need does not exist. It must be organized, funded, designed, and built. The staff must be trained. I will have to be nursed back to health. In the meantime, I hang on. Once I have retreated, I will be stable and able to handle things normally. 

3. Capitalization

As I said, this means a team, money, organization, a facility, a home for me, etc. It means everything necessary to realize a project. I am the eccentric guy with the idea.

I discovered the way nature provides to end our suffering once and for all. This is our oldest, biggest problem. So this idea is the most important in history, with commensurate benefits. In substandard form, it has saved my life twice. Perfected, it can restore humanity to health, happiness, and harmony. We will make it perfect.

I studied some business and organizations, but it is not my expertise. However things are organized, everything directly to do with the method itself has to be done my way. In some ways, this will affect how the organization operates. I will not compromise one particle of my work. I will show the door to those who fight what they are supposed to be helping with.

Participants must study my book, internalize its ideas, experience darkness my way, see what I have seen, come to believe in it, and make it their own as I have. The truth I have found is objective. Anyone can know it for himself. But only if he reads the manual and follows the instructions. 

When I am better and we are all more experienced, the situation can relax and roles can overlap. Expect some rigidity until then. We have to keep things straight till they can keep themselves straight. As I believe they will. This is a living thing. It is natural. Like walking and talking, it must be learned. Then it can fairly go on by itself.
