An individualist politics is not enough to secure freedom. An individualist form of government is necessary to apply the politics. And an individualist party is necessary to institute such a government.

Individualism has relied on centralized states and traditional parties. But they are inherently collectivist. Centralized states involve delegation of power, representation, voting, secret societies, and arcane rules and laws. Traditional parties are intellectually impure and bent toward centralized states. Together, they chew up individualist aims and spit them out as dressed up collectivist tyranny. _Form, not content, determines results_. The medium is the message. The means are the end. First we make our houses, and then they make us.

Ironically, the solution is the distributed organization of collectivist activism. Distribution suits rebelliousness and individual initiative. It reflects the legal equality that underdogs yearn for. But collectivism's function is despotism. This has to be hidden. Once power is attained, distribution is discarded for centralization. Hierarchy is fortified, crushing all kinds of rebellion.

Individualism's function is liberation. This is righteous. It does not have to change its character once it is in power. The distributed organization of an individualist party would naturally persist in an individualist form of government.
