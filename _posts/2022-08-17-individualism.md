An individualist politics is not enough to secure freedom. An individualist form of government is necessary to apply the politics. And an individualist party is necessary to institute such a government.

Individualism has relied on centralized states and traditional parties. But they are inherently collectivist. Centralized states involve delegation of power, representation, voting, secret societies, and arcane rules and laws. Traditional parties are intellectually impure and bent toward centralized states. Together, they chew up individualist philosophy and spit it out as collectivist tyranny. 

_Form, not content, determines results_. "The medium is the message" (McCluhan). The means are the end. "We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us" (Churchill).

Ironically, the solution is the distributed organization of collectivist activism. Distribution suits rebelliousness and individual initiative. It reflects the legal equality that underdogs yearn for.

But collectivism's function is despotism. This has to be hidden. Once power is attained, distribution is discarded for centralization. Hierarchy is fortified and crushes all rebellion.

Individualism's function is liberation. This is righteous. It never has to changed its character. The distributed organization of an individualist party could persist naturally in an individualist form of government.
