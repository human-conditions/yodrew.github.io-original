#### goal

- world-class darkroom in terms of function
- within limitations of budget, time, and existing wagon structure

#### current

1. major
    1. unlevel
    2. ventilation: noisy, insufficient, inefficient, vent locations cause cold drafts
    3. entry: 
        - opens onto toilet, causing issues with privacy, coordination, and lightproofing
        - top of door (and windows) unprotected from rain
	 4. toilet: 
        1. pipe upside down
        2. unventilated
        3. not private
        4. low?
        5. collection bucket too small
        6. middle bar unnecessary?
    5. wiring: surrounding occupant
    6. windows: permanently covered, unshuttered, cold, unsoundproofed
    7. hum: low frequency noise 
    8. stairs: steep, unrailed
    9. deck: small
2. minor
    1. no dining chair
    2. heater: visible light
    3. water tastes bad
    4. no mirror
    5. countertop: 
        - warping: needs reinforcement front to back in 3 places, slowly at left. Screwed in from bottom with thick, unpointed wood screws
        - incorrect height: raise for counter, lower for table. Or just raise chair and put foot stool
    5. shelves: too deep, hole at back, far from bed
    6. bed: 
        1. narrow
        2. built-in
    7. shower
        1. low bracket
        2. no curtain at end
    8. no reclining seat
3. probably impractical to solve but acceptable: low ceiling
