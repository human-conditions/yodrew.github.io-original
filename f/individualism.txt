- La Finca is a rural neighborhood development where people are finally free to: 
    - securely own a private home on registered land
    - be good neighbors with local indigenous people
    - and cooperate at whatever level is comfortable
    - all in the year-round, mild warmth at Lake Atitlan, Guatemala.
- This is accomplished by:
    - acknowledging people's need for freedom from each other so that we can sincerely be ourselves and be together. Freedom arises from a radical recognition of the rights of an individual to life, liberty, and property, with everyone having full liability for his actions. In other words, crime would be grounds for complaint. Crime touches other people's persons, space, and property without permission. Life is violated by poisoning, assault, battery, maiming, and murder. Liberty by capture and harassment. Property by vandalism, fraud, theft. Poisoning usually means pollution, which we detect through the senses: noise, air, light, electromagnetism, water, soil. Also, since land, to be owned, has to be used (not just paid for), an unoccupied holding may, after a year, result in squatting. Squatters would then have the option to buy out the owner or be paid back-rent by the owner for the next five years. After that, property would accrue to squatters.
    - offering different kinds of land for sale by the square meter. They are zoned according to a permacultural survey to maximize ease and flexibility of ownership and participation. Owners thus freely exercise their authority over the land they pay for and use and are left free from the meetings, rules, and resentments that collective ownership tends to cause.
    - requiring autonomous infrastructure as much as possible. For example, a year-round spring exists on the land to provide water, but this should only be seen and used as a back-up until people can arrange their own water storage, and will be priced accordingly.
- Land is 3 hectares/7 acres/45 cuerdas, half steep, half flat. Proposed prices/zones:
    - meadow for residences, $3/meter
    - large garden and newly planted food forest, $3/m
    - mature coffee and avocado farm, some with 1m of "black gold" topsoil, in flats. Also useful for collecting pressurized water.$4/m and hills $2.50/m.
	- farmhouse with electricity and running water (not for sale)
    - wilderness with Mayan altar (not for sale)
    - river and spring (not for sale)
    - reclamation area (damaged land to be restored)
- Ways to participate:
    - reside 
    - work
    - invest
    - visit
    - volunteer (Q__ /day)
    - partner
- Offer: buy and participate as you like. Proposed minimum purchase: $2000
- Finca culture: Many people invested or interested in the property are committed to self-sufficiency, sustainability, permaculture, indigenous rights, natural design and building, and natural health. Some see the finca as a chance to rehabilitate from civilization, and to discover, create, and live in sane, natural ways. But only the freedom to pursue these or other purposes is officially recognized, not any particular purpose itself. No one is required to believe or participate in these ways, just to not make them impossible.
- Legal structure: officially, the finca is "registered land", with a clear title going back to the 1940's. We can confidently laugh off the farm anyone showing up to demand his land back, which is very unlikely anyway. Unofficially--and this is at least as important as the official--the indigenous people of the neighboring pueblos are giving us the benefit of the doubt--some individuals actually like us--and will not violently throw us out as long as we are good neighbors. If we provide work that strengthens their culture, they will likely become fierce allies.

    Since, however, it is very difficult and prohibitively expensive to divide registered land, and since the law in Guatemala is interpreted by easily bought judges, individual plots within the finca will be internally surveyed and registered. That is to say, we will have our own, open records of land holdings and a council of senior owners, friends and neighbors of the finca, including indigenous elders, to help settle any disputes. We believe that this informal arrangement among fully interested and known parties will serve us far more effectively than the kangaroo courts of the nation. This does not represent an attempt to start a new country, but to keep the existing one out of our affairs as much as possible.
