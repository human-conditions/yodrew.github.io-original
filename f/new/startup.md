#### intro

I found the way nature gives us to reverse the cause of all our suffering and problems. It is simple, quick, cheap, pleasant, and rational. 

The original human condition is joy, health, and freedom. It only turned to suffering with mass major trauma. Which comes from the routine brutality of civilization. Which originates in 

 A man is so powerful that if even a handful are restored to  it, the system will collaps e and humanty will be freed to take care of itself



At 15, joy overcame me. It felt natural. When it faded, I searched nature for its cause. She showed me. 

The cause of joy is wholeness. Health. Biological integrity. Joy comes from success in _being_, not doing. Joy indicates that all is at it should be. Increased biological activity in adolescence had briefly restored my integrity.

Wholeness and joy dominate nature's order. But in a material universe, things collide. Global scale disaster results. Mass major trauma follows. Through cataclysm, humanity is cast into suffering for millennia between long spans of joy.

Just as nature makes us whole and breaks us with cataclysm, so does she provide the means of repair. This is nature's drama for man.

For organisms, repair means healing. The primary condition of healing is profound rest. Rest that is profound enough to heal from cataclysmic trauma occurs in extended total _darkness_.

I developed a rational, restful model for using darkness. It is rooted in hygiene, the science of health. So it is called hygienic darkroom retreating. It is radical yet subtle. Its effects are massive and rapid. It reliably leads to miracles. 


These include:

- relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness  
- natural healing from trauma, the cause of suffering
- restoration of the personal power necessary for freedom
- return of the lost self and the recovery of joy

I wrote a book about it. 
My readers and I tasted these benefits in trial retreats. 
Now, with a complete model, everyone can fully benefit. 
This requires a self-supporting, organized team. 
Thus...

#### startup

I am starting a business. We will do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating:

- writing, speaking, teaching, interviews, and media production
- consultation, retreat support
- research and development
- manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and installation
- sales of related products from other companies, including humane computer technology

The business has unlimited potential. The model has implications for every field. It will not merely transform an industry. It will redefine the world's economy and our entire way of life.. To begin funding it, I am: 

- preselling our catalog:
    - information: my book in paper, lectures
    - services: consultation, retreats
    - goods: componentry, darkrooms, microfactories, neighborhoods
- fundraising with asset-backed credits
- initiating the start-up process to form the business and attract capital. Credits purchased now will be redeemable for future investment offerings at a bonus rate.

The vision of Human Conditions is to restore humanity to the original human condition of joy, health, and freedom. Our mission is to make darkness approachable by ordinary people on normal terms. This means making it a turn-key, franchise operation. _Click_, and it just works. I mean simply, perfectly, beautifully, in every way, for everyone involved.

Human Conditions will be the first darkroom operation to meet this world-class standard. Most people do not have time for anything less. There is no reason they should. 

The world desperately needs a way back to sanity. Yet the soul maintains its composure at all costs. It has endured all while awaiting nature's perfect solution.

The presale's unusual **terms** reward past supporters. The **catalog** lists offerings with  delivery dates, prices, and drop-down descriptions. It is also the order form, with fields for quantities and options . The **goal** of the presale is $11,400. The **plan** tells how we will start up.

_Return of the Lost Self_  
_the hygienic use of darkness_

This is the complete manual of hygienic darkroom retreating. It is the way nature gives us to reverse the cause of our suffering and problems: unhealed major trauma. As organisms, we are self-healing, provided the proper conditions. The primary condition of healing is profound rest. The most profound rest occurs in an extended stay in total darkness. See [blurb](/) for full description and to begin reading. 200p.

#### goal: $11,400

The goal is staged. Once I reach $3000, I can begin work on the book. I will make up any shortfall through the startup process (see plan). This will not delay book production but assembly drawings and book redesign may wait till next edition.

A third of the income from each stage will pay for items listed. Two-thirds will pay business costs: manufacturing, expenses, and debts. Shipping is not included.

| Stage | Item                                    | Amount |  Goal |
| -----:| ----------------------------------------| ------:| ----: |     
|     1 | hygienic computer, keyboard             |   3000 |  3000 |     
|     2 | legal counsel for forming business      |   3000 |  6000 |     
|     3 | assembly drawings for book              |   3000 |  9000 |     
|     4 | copy editing, proofreading, book design |   2400 | 11400 |     

#### plan

Steps are roughly in order. Some will happen concurrently.

1. launch presale
    - find members of my network to share presale with their networks
    - reach first stage of goal
    - pay for new computer
    - update and expand promotion of presale
2. edit book
    - integrate final pieces of model
    - refine organization of book content
    - simplify sentence structure for clarity, easier reading, and better machine translation
    - hire draftsman to make assembly drawings
    - get book copyedited, proofread, and designed
    - print and ship on schedule
3. develop business
    - study the startup process 
    - create pitch deck, investment plan, and other standard documents
    - use documents to present the business to attract further funding and team members
    - begin organizing work together
4. produce components: 
    - develop production processes and tooling 
    - refine prototypes
    - produce and ship components on schedule
5. misc
    - lecture: 
         - refine existing talk according to model
         - begin speaking in public
    - produce microfactory kits, prototype darkroom, design neighborhood
    - seminar: plan and organize
    - expand catalog with related products from others

#### qualifications and risks

I could print the current edition of the book right now and ship it. Over the years, I have done so many times. Basically, it is good. Readers find it substantive, clear, and well-written. It contains a thousand times more information than I had when I first retreated. Its theme, the restful use of darkness, has remained constant.

The book has 98% of the content I want it to have when it ships in five months. From tests, I know how long my intended method of revision takes. Making theoretical breakthroughs as I work and managing the pre-sale will take more time. It is all built into the schedule to ensure timely delivery.

I have produced or prototyped everything in the list except where noted. I have experience shipping things internationally from both America and Europe. 
I grew up around small business. My father, his business partners, extended family, and friends always whisked me behind the scenes to see how things worked. I have worked closely with entrepreneurs in both publishing and manufacturing, read business books my whole life, and have done business consulting. I know double-entry accounting, spreadsheets, simple programming, basic law, history, philosophy. I have recovered enough personal power to succeed in a rough and tumble world. 

Through rehydration, a hygienic practice, I have recently found a simple way to reverse the worst of my crippling health issues. Day by day, I am restored to function. This is another example, in 32 years of relentless, uncompromising effort, of my resourcefulness and diligence in finding ways to continue. After nine months of gestating my completed model, I am clear about what I am doing and how to proceed.

Socially, a stable web of relationships with my neighbors and international collaborators holds me. Politically and economically, I am still vulnerable. This presale is designed to amend that. The legal help I will retain will help me deal with the strange political changes occurring globally.

Inaction is the biggest risk we face. If no one tries to realize this idea, if its influence never bears on world conditions, we will lack the most powerful possible means of dealing with the nonsense that confronts us today. The Adversary has lately increased his destabilizing pressure. I have studied his ways for the last three years and minimized my exposure. I'm a survivor with a unique set of skills. I'll find a way to fill your order and execute my plan.

#### conclusion

"Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world," said Archimedes. A corollary is to find the small lever at the world's center that activates all its processes. 

Nature has revealed that lever to me as the hygienic use of darkness. It widens the baffling bottleneck we are stuck in. It enables the human soul to rapidly restore itself and then the world. It is the most crucial thing possible to do. The task has stretched me to the breaking point several times. Somehow, it keeps easing me back. So far, so good.

Thank you for your ongoing interest, consideration, and support. Today, we begin again.

I believe joy is natural. Nature gives us an essential condition to reverse the cause of our suffering and restore joy: darkness. I discovered this through a long investigation. With hygiene, the science of health, I developed a model⁠It results in:

I believe joy is natural. So I searched nature for its cause... and found it. Nature does give us the way to reverse the cause of all our suffering and problems. 

In 2019, I completed developing a model of it. It is called hygienic darkroom retreating. It reliably produces miracles. These include:

- relief, rest, and recovery from distress, exhaustion, and illness
- natural healing from cataclysmic trauma, the root cause of human suffering
- the return of the lost self
- restoration of personal power

My readers and I have glimpsed these benefits in preliminary retreats. Now we can realize them fully. This requires a self-supporting, organized team. Thus...

Recovery could include dental decay, aging itself, and even birth defects.
Miracles, it turns out, are easy. You just have to provide the conditions.
